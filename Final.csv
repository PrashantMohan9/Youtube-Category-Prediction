2,xHUTACt84n0,10 Best Places to Visit in Austria - Travel Video,"Austria is a country that is as well known for its scenic beauty as it is for its cultural activities. Situated in the Alps, it is a very popular place with skiers and hikers, but it is also a country that gave the world an important musical heritage, ranging from the classical composer Mozart to the Strauss waltzes and the Von Trapp family whose story was told in The Sound of Music. An overview of the best places to visit in Austria:",Travel Blogs
3,I1QBHhbS0,Salzburg Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Salzburg.d180...

The Austrian city of Salzburg is situated on the northern edge of the Alps, close to the border of Germany. Surrounded by lakes and mountains, and straddling the banks of the Salzach River, few cities can match Salzburg‚Äôs fairytale setting.
 
Few places can match its musical heritage either. Salzburg is the hometown of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and provided the settings for one of cinema‚Äôs most-adored musicals, The Sound Of Music. 
  
Take the funicular to Hohensalzburg, one of Europe‚Äôs best-preserved medieval fortresses. Down below in the Old Town you‚Äôll find Salzburg Cathedral and the Salzburg Museum. Nearby, wander along narrow Getreidegasse, one of the loveliest shopping streets in the world. 
 
Just off the Old Market Square, savor 300 years of coffee-making tradition at Caf√© Tomaselli. For classical Austrian fare served with a side of Opera, take the short walk to Stiftskeller St. Peter. At the M√ºllner Br√§u Brewery, hang out with beer devotees from all over the world. 
 
Salzburg has long been a city where inspiration knows no bounds, especially when it comes to its palaces. Just a short stroll from the Marionette Theater, the grandeur of Mirabell Palace and Gardens awaits. While on Salzburg‚Äôs southern outskirts, explore the playful water features at Hellbrunn Palace.
 
While Salzburg abounds with fountains, some of the city‚Äôs most impressive water features are its natural ones, such as Lake Wolfgang and Krimml Waterfall. For a waterfall with a difference, visit the spa town of Bad Gastein, whose falls roar straight through the heart of town. From the town, take the cable car to the summit of Stubnerkogel Mountain and walk Europe‚Äôs highest suspension bridge.
 
The Salzburg region is full of surprises, so before heading back to the city, head underground, into the Hallein Salt Mine. From its salt mines to its symphonies, from its fountains to its waterfalls, Salzburg plays out like a living opera, filled with drama, comedy, intrigue and passion.",Travel Blogs
4,MRI8ffYKA8,Vienna Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Vienna.d17831...

On your next trip to Austria, pay a visit to its capital city of Vienna. During the late 19th and early 20th century, this city became a cultural epicenter of Europe, contributing art, philosophy, and culture on its way to becoming one of the world‚Äôs great cities.

During your Vienna sightseeing, you can drink coffee in the same cafes as Einstein and Freud, or wander down the streets that inspired Beethoven. Tour galleries devoted to some of the most magnificent artwork in all of Europe, then walk along the Ringstrasse. Also called ‚ÄúRing Road,‚Äù this downtown boulevard home to private residences, palaces, and other exquisite examples of architecture for you to marvel at. 

Much of Vienna tourism is centered in its cafes. This is not just because its residents love strong coffee‚Äîthough they do‚Äîbut because Viennese social life largely grows out of its coffee houses. Locals will spend hours at their favorite cafes, reading the paper, speaking to friends, working on projects, or listening to music in the evenings. Sit at a table and watch the people of Vienna stroll by, or enjoy a sachertorte, or chocolate cake, while catching up on your latest novel. It‚Äôs impossible to visit this city and not be inspired.

Vienna has long been called The City of Music. Find out why at the Vienna State Opera; a backstage tour will show you all the ins and outs of this majestic place, as well as give you a glimpse of why it has been at the forefront of entertainment since its construction in the 1800s. Afterward, head a few blocks south to the Volksgarten, or people‚Äôs garden. Stroll through its pathways and sniff the sweet fragrance of its hundreds of roses. What better way to end a day in one of the world‚Äôs most beautiful cities? 

What was your favorite part of Vienna?

I've been a full-time blogger / travel vlogger for 9 years and transformed myself into a full-time travel blogger in the past 3 years. I will teach you how to create a website, build a brand and get you setup on the path to getting paid to travel. When I first started out in 2016, I didn't have a clue about how to take a decent photo and forget about shooting video. Today, I'm proud to say I'm halfway decent as a photographer and videographer and have racked up 800k followers on social and 1.5 million views on YouTube.

// How Much Money Can You Make As a Travel Blogger?

Since starting my travel influencer account, I've earned more than $200,000 from a combination of affiliate commission, paid sponsors, adsense and selling my own products. This is definitely a career that if you work hard and build yourself up, you can easily quit your job and live your dreams.

// How to Make a Blog [2019] Focused on Travel Blogging

My advice for any new website is to use Wordpress. First of all, it's free, unlike SquareSpace which costs money to use and locks you into their hosting provider. With a Wordpress website, you can move it to any hosting provider (whether it be Bluehost or Hostgator when you first start out) or WPEngine when you really grow your blog and have a ton of traffic.

// How to Start a Blog and Become a Full Time Blogger

Setting up your first website should take no more than 15 minutes. Your steps are:

Pick your domain name
Sign up for your hosting plan
Install Wordpress
Install your theme
Start blogging
Setup your blog here for just $3.95:

// How to Write a Travel Blog

The really daunting task is shooting good photos and videos and telling stories as a travel blogger. I started out blogging not knowing a thing about how to shoot photos or videos but thanks to Youtube, I was able to teach myself everything I needed to learn. I suggest you do the same thing, start searching on YouTube and teach yourself.

In this video, I walk you through exactly what my steps are to starting and making money with your own travel blog.

I‚Äôve tried almost every possible Monetization strategy and these are my proven methods that work for me:

Affiliate marketing where you get paid a commission for selling something
Paid advertisements like Crest paying me to review their white strips
Adsense revenue which I get from people watching this video and clicking on ads on my website
Freelancing: taking photos, building websites or providing consulting to small businesses
Selling a product: I have a style guide I created last year and it sells a couple of copies every month

// my proven techniques as a full time travel blogger

// find your speciality
- Say you want to be a travel blogger, what‚Äôs one thing you‚Äôll bring on every trip that everyone needs? A great bag. Imagine you took a different bag on every trip and reviewed it as part of the vlog. I guarantee you‚Äôd be one of the few experts reviewing just bags and you‚Äôd be able to corner the market. And when you do your videos, it would be really hard for someone like me or anyone else to copy your knowledge base and expertise
- Besides travel bags you could also focus on bug spray, sunscreen, backup batteries, etc find something you‚Äôre interested in and own it

// This will be hard, but follow these tips to ensure you succeed

Transcript:

You're joining me in a very special city. Let‚Äôs start with my preconceptions: I expected Japan‚Äôs capital, and home to the world‚Äôs largest urban population to be over the top and really in your face, with neon lights and anime at every turn and i certainly wasn‚Äôt disappointed. The streets are lined with towering, multi-storey buildings, each filled with mind bending department stores and arcades, offices to some of the world‚Äôs biggest brands and restaurants serving the best food you‚Äôll ever taste.

But despite all the apparent madness and chaos, spend a few days in Tokyo and it just makes sense. Here, efficiency is an art form. Japanese attention to detail is legendary, and it runs through everything, from food to public transport and urban planning. And yes, even the toilets. 

This trip was an educational and weirdly enlightening experience. I‚Äôve been lucky to visit a lot of amazing places making these videos, but Tokyo is in a league of its own.

So Tokyo, it‚Äôs big, it‚Äôs busy and it‚Äôs brilliant. As ever, let‚Äôs start with the airports.

Flying from the UK you‚Äôll come into one of Tokyo‚Äôs two major international airports, Haneda or Narita. Of course, you don‚Äôt need me to tell you that Tokyo is a really long way away, direct flights from Europe will take a whopping 12 hours for the nine and a half thousand kilometre journey.

So you‚Äôve got Haneda airport which is roughly 13 miles south of the city, and then you‚Äôve got 50 miles east. Fortunately, both are really easy to get to noisy noisy Tokyo. Here‚Äôs what you need to know.

From Haneda you have three main options, the airport limousine bus, a taxi or the monorail. The airport limousine takes between 30 and 45 minutes, stopping at most major hotels in the centre of town, with prices increasing for the night service between midnight and 5am.

A taxi should take about half and hour depending on traffic, with prices depending where you‚Äôre being dropped off. There‚Äôs also a 20% extra charge between 10pm and 5am.

However the quickest option is the airport‚Äôs dedicated monorail. It‚Äôll get you into Hamamatsucho station in 13 minutes and from here you can connect to the circular Yamanote metro line to reach other parts of the city. 

The metro runs between 9 and 7 on weekdays and then 9 to 5 on weekends and public holidays. That‚Äôs Haneda! Here‚Äôs what you need to know about Narita.

Narita is a whopping 50 miles east of Tokyo, so all of your transport options are going to take a while. The Airport Limousine bus and taxis runs from Narita but both will take anywhere between 90 minutes to 2 hours to reach central Tokyo. Instead, take the JR Narita Express. It‚Äôll whisk into town in a little under an hour, and with this being Japan, the trains are on time and super efficient.

A word of warning about getting home; if you‚Äôre flight‚Äôs on a Sunday, make sure you check the train times because there‚Äôs a reduced service. Check your departure time, and then allow plenty of extra time to get to the airport.",Travel Blogs

I lived in Paris on my own when I was 18/19 so it was so amazing to get to show off my favorite spots to some of my favorite people. We didn't hit many of the main touristy spots because most of us had done them before and wanted to just enjoy every day life in the city.

After presenting our passports and checking into our 4 birth cabin, we settled in for the night on our train. To be honest it was a little smaller than some trains we have caught in the past but we had a comfortable sleep anyways...besides the 5am wake up call!

After arriving in Moscow for Jess birthday she decided that she wanted to go inside a Russian bunker...so we went to the Cold War Museum aka Bunker 42 where went 68 meters below ground and learnt more about this soviet bunker.

To celebrate her birthday we went out to have dinner (and a Moscow mule) at Razvedka (–†–∞–∑–≤–µ–¥–∫–∞).

A one-hour journey taking in the whole of Switzerland. Seems impossible? Not in Swissminiatur, the park reproducing a miniature version of the Swiss Confederation. The Park covers 14,000 m¬≤. Dotted around the park you can admire the over 128 1:125 scale models of the most famous buildings and monuments in Switzerland.

The detailed and authentic models include well-known sites such as the castles of Rapperswil, Chillon and Bellinzona, the Federal Parliament in Bern and the Piazza Grande in Locarno.

And this is not all: a network of 3560 metres of miniature railway wends its way through the Park with 18 trains running on tracks, crossing bridges and stopping at stations, whilst boats ply the lakes, cable cars and funiculars climb and descend mountains and cars run along the motorways.

Swissminiatur was inaugurated in 1959 and this year celebrates the 60th anniversary of its foundation, a jubilee that its management wants to dedicate to manual and to the craftsmen who take good care of the miniatures of the park every day.

The events on offer are always appealing and young and old alike are sure to have fun at Swissminiatur.

I never got confronted with this kind of violence - I was brought to the hospital and spend around 5 hours there.
It was at some point maybe also my fault as said in the video - but bad things can happen everywhere in the world. 

I was amazed by the great help I received afterwards from all the people around me - especially the argentine people have been so nice to me which actually makes me even love Argentina more!

75,6BoYfs2I0r8,How I make money while traveling the world (and eating),"‚ñ∫How to Start a Travel Blog: https://migrationology.com/how-to-sta...
‚ñ∫How to Make Money While Traveling: 

The number one question I get asked is how I can afford to travel, while making money, and blogging. I'm going to answer how I make money, and also how I can afford to travel and eat in this video. Also, I'll share how I think you can do it too!

There are many many ways to make money while traveling, and I have friends that are working on cruise ships, blogging, affiliate marketing, freelance writing, and even skydiving, while earning money to be able to maintain a lifestyle traveling. But instead of sharing all the ways on how to make money traveling, I'll first share the ways I make money.

First I want to say that all of these ways that I make money while traveling are all the result of initially starting a blog back in 2009 and committing to writing quality and useful information on it on a regular basis. 

If you want to make money while traveling, I'd highly recommend you start a blog on whatever you're passionate about and begin blogging high quality useful information to show your expertise, and also connecting with others. (If you're just starting a travel blog, Travel Blog Success is an excellent course that I recommend:  [affiliate])

1. Affiliate recommendations - This basically means earning a small commission as a referral. There are many companies (places like Amazon and Agoda.com for hotels) that offer a commission if you refer someone to a purchase. As an example, on my website I give away a lot of free useful tips about visiting Bangkok (). And I also recommend a few hotels which, some of which I've previously stayed at, and others which I've just visit and highly recommend. So if you were to click one of the links and book that hotel, I would get a small commission as a referral. I only recommend things that I use myself or trust.
2. My premium travel and food guides - The biggest way I make money while traveling is by selling my premium travel and food guides (). Right now I have the Bangkok 101 things to do guide, Eating Thai Food Guide, Vegetarian Thai Food Guide, and the Delhi travel guide, and I'm working on more. I prefer to sell my own guides than doing advertising on my website, because I can trust in the quality of my own guides.
3. Freelance writing - As a result of first starting my travel blog back in 2009, I've had the opportunity to do numerous freelance writing projects, some big and some small. I've written for a few inflight magazines, as well as CNN Travel, and various other newspapers, magazines, and websites. I used to dislike writing, but the more I started blogging about thing I really enjoyed (like food) the more I enjoyed it. And after committing to it and blogging, I've been able to connect with so many others and had chances to write for many places. A blog is a great way for you to have a public profile of your expertise.
4. Video, YouTube - Finally, the fourth way of how I make money while traveling and blogging is through videos. I made the decision to start making videos and I have committed to it. Ads on some of my videos is another chunk of my monthly income.

Along with how to make money while traveling and blogging, it's also important to say how I can afford to travel? Most of the money my wife and I make now goes back into our traveling and eating. However, it's all about your priorities. We don't own a car and pay for gas, and instead we choose to buy plane tickets and eat street food. You have to set your own goals and priorities and live intentionally to pursue them.

82,KtRsk4Bjs9,Perth Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Perth.d180013...

A modern city, Perth is the gem of Australia‚Äôs west coast and the capital of Western Australia. This friendly metropolis boasts pristine beaches, clear water, and plenty of coastline ‚Äì not to mention an abundance of nature and mineral resources.

Start your day of Perth sightseeing with a walk through Kings Park, which is larger than New York‚Äôs Central Park and home to the Western Australia Botanic Garden. More than 3,000 species of Western Australia‚Äôs plant life, including vibrant flowers, are on display here. Most of the park consists of bushland, which means lots of wildlife and quite a few walking trails.

After a morning of reflection in the park, head over to the Swan Bell Tower to enjoy a spectacular view of the city. Don‚Äôt forget your camera! You will notice the diverse nature of Perth‚Äôs architecture from this vantage point, including the modern glass structures and London-inspired Tudor buildings. 

Perth tours are never complete without a ferry ride to Rottnest Island, affectionately called ‚ÄúRotto‚Äù by the locals. This getaway is rife with opportunities to snorkel in the Indian Ocean, see wildlife such as seals and birds, and travel across more than 31 miles of cycle ways on a rented bicycle.

Once your feet are back on mainland Western Australia, visit one of the jewels, and ultimately what draws much of the Perth tourism: Swan Valley. This region has a landscape peppered with vineyards, no surprise given that growing grapes has been a long-standing tradition in Swan Valley. Following a short (or leisurely paced) day trip to Swan Valley, return to Perth and head to Hillarys Boat Harbour for a sunset dinner. 

What will you do in Perth?

88,2jS0Fd3WQVg,"NUUK - Travel in Nuuk, Greenland","Adventure, incredible hiking, fishing and boat rides - it doesn‚Äôt get much more picturesque than Greenland and nowhere more so than the capital city Nuuk.

If you loved our look at Nuuk, check out the site for more articles on Greenland -  - and make sure to SUBSCRIBE for tons of travel porn, including two more episodes in Southern Greenland - 

‚úà‚úà‚úà

Nuuk is the capital of Greenland, and with about 17,000 residents, it holds almost a quarter of the population of the whole country.

In this episode, Brianna and Macca discover what the city has to offer and go on some epic adventures just outside of it.

There is a lot going on in this big city with a small town feel, from nightlife to concerts and more and more restaurants popping up. 

Within minutes in any direction, you can find a gorgeous look out point.

We met up with Anna Nivika, a local food blogger who is really changing the way that Greenlanders use food.

We had to try some for ourselves, and got to experience a traditional Greenlandic BBQ on the beach at Inuk Hostels.

We went on two tours with Touring Greenland that blew us away. First, we visited the abandoned settlement of Kangeq and loved it so much that we planned another.

We went on the most incredible hike amongst mountains, streams and snow, ending up at the edge of a giant waterfall. We were met with a boat that picked us up and took us fishing for our dinner.

Once we had caught it, we visited a restaurant that cooked our fish for us, along with a plethora of other delicious treats.

Located on the east coast of the island overlooking the Trincomalee Harbour, 113 miles south of Jaffna and 69 miles north of Batticaloa, Trincomalee has been one of the main centres of Sri Lankan Tamil language speaking culture on the island for over two millennia. With a population of 99,135, the city is built on a peninsula of the same name, which divides its inner and outer harbours. People from Trincomalee are known as Trincomalians and the local authority is Trincomalee Urban Council. Trincomalee city is home to the famous Koneswaram temple alluded to in its historic Tamil name Thirukonamalai and is home to other historical monuments such as the Bhadrakali Amman Temple, Trincomalee, the Trincomalee Hindu Cultural Hall and, opened in 1897, the Trincomalee Hindu College. Trincomalee is also the site of the Trincomalee railway station and an ancient ferry service to Jaffna and the south side of the harbour at Muttur. The recorded history of Trincomalee spans more than two and a half thousand years, beginning with civilian settlement associated with the Koneswaram temple in the pre-modern era. One of the oldest cities in Asia, it has served as a major maritime seaport in the international trading history of the island with South East Asia. In the ancient world, it was successively the capital of eastern kingdoms of the Vanni country, developing under the Anuradhapura Kingdom, Pallava Dynasty, Chola Dynasty, Pandyan Dynasty, the Vannimai chieftaincies and the Jaffna kingdom through the Koneswaram shrine's revenue. Trincomalee's urbanization continued when made into a fortified port town following the Portuguese conquest of the Jaffna kingdom, changing hands between the Danish in 1620, the Dutch, the French following a battle of the American Revolutionary War and the British in 1795, being absorbed into the British Ceylon state in 1815. The city's architecture shows some of the best examples of interaction between native and European styles. Attacked by the Japanese as part of the Indian Ocean raid during World War II in 1942, the city and district were affected after Sri Lanka gained independence in 1948, when the political relationship between Tamil and Sinhalese people deteriorated, erupting into civil war. It is home to major naval and air force bases at the Trincomalee Garrison. The city also has the largest Dutch fort on the island. One of several videos we filmed while in Sri Lanka, this video vlog was shot just outside Negombo. Pol sambola (coconut sambol) is a traditional Sri Lankan dish made from coconut, mostly used as an accompaniment with rice, string hoppers, hoppers, and many more meals. Sri Lankan cuisine has been shaped by many historical, cultural, and other factors. Foreign traders who brought new food items; influences from Indonesian cuisine and the cuisine of Southern India have all helped to shape Sri Lankan cuisine. Today, some of the staples of Sri Lankan cuisine are rice, coconut, and spices. The latter are used due to Sri Lanka's history as a spice producer and trading post over several centuries. Kottu is a spicy stir-fry of shredded roti bread with vegetables. Optional ingredients include eggs, meat, or cheese. It was invented in Batticaloa and literally means 'chopped roti' in Tamil.  -  -  -  -  -  -  - ",Travel Blogs

When you think of your job as a travel blogger, it's ultimately to provide value to your readers. It's normal human behavior to want to talk about lots of different topics, but in order to be a successful travel blogger or influencer, you need to consider perfecting your niche. 

Think of all the successful travel bloggers you love and look up to. Are they talking about tons of different topic, or really zoning in on a few in particular? 9/10 - they have travel as the umbrella, but are focusing on 2 or 3 sub niches (adventure, culinary, motivation)

If you're using SEO tactics to drive traffic to your blog, you want to ensure that the person that comes to your blog for the first time, knows what to expect. If you have posts on motherhood, travel, fitness and fashion, you will most likely lose them as a loyal follower. While they may be interested in all these topics, they found your site via search, and are looking for more topics that cover this area. 

In today's video, I'll talk more about why getting niche will transform your travel blog or instagram, and tactics on how to get started!

98,i2-8UEW4M,Langkawi | Sunset Dinner Cruise with Naam Adventures | Malaysia Luxury Travel Blog,"It's a pretty safe bet that I'm going to be signing up for anything that includes wine, a dinner cruise, and an absolutely memorable, picture-perfect sunset.  When I landed on Langkawi and started asking around at the Meritus Pelangi Beach for recommendations on the best cruise operator, the team there shared that they favour Naam and recommended their 3-hour evening dinner cruise on the Sea Falcon so I signed up to go a few days later.  Since I was just one person and staying at the jungle hotel Ambong Ambong (and not one of the main luxury properties they have scheduled pickups at), they provided very swish transfer service in a shiny black sedan that felt wonderfully VIP following days of vans and taxis.

Ohhhh and it turns out I was the only non-Chinese guest aboard that night and I had a hoot and a half!  The wine was flowing, the food was actually really yummy, and the ambiance on the Sea Falcon was perfect.  A bit of a party at the beginning, and then we went into a chill-out vibe closer to sunset.

NOTE: for the first time in over a year, I accidentally deleted the video footage I shot on my Nikon while transferring files.  So, what you'll see is still fun but it's sadly an 'Angela show' because it's what I shot from my iPhone.  I'm so sad, as I shot some amazing footage that night.  Anyway, do check it out, it's just missing the long shots and food and boat interior images.

If you think of Siargao, most will brand it as the ‚ÄúSurfing Capital of the Philippines‚Äù, Siargao can cater to anyone who‚Äôs in quest to experience what the island has to offer. Beautifully diverse landscapes from mangroves, enchanting forest, rock formations, waterfalls, vast rice fields, cave pools, calm white sand beach, and nearby islands. I‚Äôve been to most beautiful and pristine islands in the Philippines and I thought I have seen it all. Siargao is authentically in its truest form strikingly, inexplicably and beyond beautiful.

Sohoton Caves, Bocas Grande (1.5-2 hour boat ride from Gen Luna). Sohoton Lagoon and Caves is a 600+ hectare eco-reserve situated in the isolated south of Bocas Grande island. Accessible only on lower tides, this pristine sanctuary offers a grand experience of jellyfish swimming, caving, snorkeling, swimming, kayaking, and for landlubbers, hiking and walking tours. The trip is conducted by boat and are organized by local fishermen. Visitors are first required to sign up before embarking on smaller vessels. 500 entrance. 

Surf Cloud 9, Cloud 9, Brgy 5, General Luna. One of the best known surfing waves, known for thick, hollow tubes. Cloud 9 also has a reputation for being a relatively cheap destination for surfers with many cheap accommodations and restaurants and bars to choose from. For beachcombers and first timers, the best time to pack one‚Äôs bags is during summer, from March to May. For hard-core surfers, bigger swells occur during the windy months from August to November. An annual surfing cup is held on September. Surfers from all over the world converge at General Luna to ride the waves and party. There are several other quality waves on Siargao and nearby islands, but Cloud 9 has received more publicity than any other surf spot in the Philippines. It is the only wave easily accessible without a boat, leading to overcrowding and the nickname of ""Crowd 9"" among surfers.  

Mangrove Exploration, Del Carmen, [1]. SThis means a trip requires sturdy sandals, dry bags to waterproof essentials and the acceptance that you will get wet! The country‚Äôs largest contiguous mangrove stand, which is also the second largest in Mindanao, is found here. In fact, Siargao‚Äôs mangroves are one of the two remaining sites in the country where the rare iron wood or magcono tree still grows. Eco-tourists will enjoy a day paddling amid the mangrove forests, kayaking through waters home to rich marine life. Feeling a little exploratory? Linger a bit longer and you may just catch a glimpse of the salt water crocodile, marine turtles, and the sea cow. The mangrove forest is a thriving, living ecosystem, home to many endemic species.  
Island Hopping, [2]. half-day or full-day. From the shores of General Luna, three distinct shapes visible in the horizon are best bets for island hopping: Naked, Guyam, and Daku island. Naked and Guyam islands are uninhabited white sand islets, while Daku island has a small fishing community  
Game fishing, Pilar town. Game fishing is popular in the fishing grounds of Pilar. Anglers all over the world arrive every May for the International Game Fishing competition. Anglers are billeted at homestays, which are rooms in the locals‚Äô homes, where they get to experience authentic Surigaonon meals. Most houses in Pilar are perched on stilts, atop swampy ponds with mangrove trees clustered around them. A stay in these unique homes is already an adventure in itself. 
Driftwood Watersports, Cloud 9 Rd, Brgy 5 (1km toward Cloud 9 from GL,  [3]. The largest surf shop on the island. Driftwood offers new/used/rental surf boards and SUPs, apparel, and surf accessories. Driftwood also provides accommodations, airport/ferry transportation and water transportation and activities.

103,nPOO1Coe2DI,Dubai Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Dubai-Emirate....

Come to Dubai, the ancient City of Gold, for your next vacation.

Modernity and antiquity collide in this vibrant city. Shop at the same spice market locals have been visiting for generations, then visit the stores in the Gold Souk, a jewelry-centered traditional marketplace. For a more modern shopping experience, go to the Dubai Mall, home to over 1200 stores, an underwater zoo, and KidZania¬Æ, a ‚Äúcity‚Äù where children can roleplay various careers.

To soak up some of the legendary Dubai sunshine, simply step outside. Take in the view of the city from the observation deck of the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world. Continue your Dubai tour by wandering through the exotic buildings and resorts, or visit some of the public beaches. If you‚Äôd like to try something a little different and don‚Äôt mind paying a small fee, you can also attend local hotel beaches even if you aren‚Äôt staying there.

You can‚Äôt finish your Dubai sightseeing without a trip into the desert itself. Ride a camel, go sandboarding, or just stand out on the dunes and marvel at the beauty of it all. 

Visit our Dubai travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!

Here is a look at our first three days in the Maldives. It was a quick turnaround from Dubai (I literally got straight back off the plane I came off - definitely could have planned that better). But oh my god, it was so worth the travelling. It's just out of this world.

The Bali Travel Guide serves as a guide and inspiration for people looking to travel to Bali for the first time. The Bali guide suggests sights to see, activities to do, or dishes to eat. It includes my top things to do and places to visit in Bali and is based on my travel to Bali during the summer of 2017. I spent roughly two weeks on the island visiting Ubud, the Gili Islands, and Seminyak. 

I tried to add as much helpful information as I could, which I hope provides a good idea on how to travel Bali or at least serve as a form of inspiration. If you have any suggestions or feedback feel free to comment below, as any feedback is appreciated, I hope you find the video useful. Don't forget to like and subscribe for more content!

The festival begins with the lighting of the Holika bonfire the night before, which represents the victory of good over evil. There are many legends associated with this festival, one of the more prominent ones being of demon King Hiranyakashyap .



If you are in Rishikesh at this time, you will come to the realization that the Holi fever has spread far and wide and there are people, many people who come specially to India to experience the same, with Rishikesh being one of the sought after destinations. Also, the 15th Annual International Yoga festival, organized by the Parmarth Niketan Ashram was on at the same time which draws in a huge crowd. There is a general air of merriment and excitement as you walk the narrow lanes of this town. The night before, the ‚ÄúHolika‚Äù is burnt at Laxman Jhula chowk (main crossing), which signifies the start of Holi. People gather around the fire, sing and wish each other. On the day of Holi, the Laxman Jhula chowk becomes the venue for a very public party, crowds gather, both locals and otherwise, there is popular Bollywood music blaring from loudspeakers, everyone is smearing everyone else with colors and wishing each other, and the atmosphere is very fun and festive

130,AQ6GmpMu5L8,Paris Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Paris.d179898....

Paris, the capital of France, attracts 42 million visitors a year. 

You can start your Paris tour on the metro, on foot, or with a taxi or bicycle; the city is easily navigable on all fronts. Visit the Arc de Triomphe in the center of the city and marvel at its graceful lines and commanding presence. Built between 1806 and 1836, the Arc is one of a number of historical arches and landmarks peppering Paris.

If your Paris sightseeing includes purchasing souvenirs, head to the Champs-√âlys√©es, home of boutique shopping, numerous restaurants, and many bars, along with a theatre and other entertaining venues. Learn about culture and creativity at the Louvre, a 14th-century palace turned art museum, and check in on the Mona Lisa and her mysterious smile. Notre Dame Cathedral cannot be missed, as this imposing Gothic structure has stood since 1345.

Speaking of imposing, the Eiffel Tower is most frequently used to represent Paris. Stroll beneath it to get a good idea of its height, or travel to the top for a stunning view of the City of Light. 

Visit our Paris travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!

133,xq2UYBD00,Langkawi | SkyBridge & Glass Bottom CableCar | Malaysia Luxury Travel Blog,"Glass bottomed cable cars, panoramic views, and a terrifying glass window you can stand on hundreds of feet above ground ... well, those are just three reasons that the Langkawi SkyBridge and SkyCar experience is definitely the biggest and best 'must do and see' activity on Langkawi.  Opened in February 2005, the main boarding station for the gondola-style cable cars is located at the foothills of the picturesque Machincang mountain, said to be on a part of Southeast Asia that is the most ancient and the first to have emerged from the sea.

The SkyBridge is the longest 'free span' and curved bridge in the world and it's exciting just to be standing on it!  I had a challenging but fabulous time as you'll see from the video :-)

3 Tips for the Best Langkawi SkyBridge and SkyCab Experience:

1 - Ride in the glass bottomed cable car!  Although the VIP gondolas are pretty cool with music, food & drinks, and only 3 comfy seats per car, I prefer the 95 Ringgit glass bottom SkyCabs for their roomy feel and amazing views.  Don't even consider the normal SkyCab, trust me on this one.
2 - Opt for the SkyGlide!  To go from the top station to the SkyBridge in just a few seconds, riding on the SkyGlide is a breeze and only an extra 10 Ringgits.  Otherwise you have 12 minutes of stairs up and back.
3 - Take off your shoes!  As you walk along Langkawi's SkyBridge you'll notice that a few of the floor panels are made of glass, giving you a birds-eye view of the canyon below.  For some reason, the feeling of standing on that was one of the scariest things I've done in AGES!  It's truly spine chilling but absolutely worth it.  It's one of my favourite memories of the SkyBridge for some reason.

Koh Samui is definitely Thailand's hotspot island destination this year and after spending a week there I understand why.  To me it felt like a cross between Bali and Langkawi with a bit of Phuket mixed in.  The diversity of the landscapes change quickly between white sandy beaches, rugged cliffs, and hillsides and jungle terrain that would be impassable if it weren't for ORVs.
    

FULL REVIEW + tons of pics and observations on my travel blog: 

Your Koh Samui Luxury Guide:

- Bangkok Airways will likely be your airline.  They fly on-time, serve complimentary hot meals in economy, and Samui is seriously the coolest small airport I've ever seen  

- Mantra Samui Resort & Spa is chilled and ideally situated on the island.  Check them out on Facebook or their website, they were the perfect home base for exploring Samui for a week  

- Hop on a Clear Water sunset cruise via Samui Private Yacht, which I rented for 2 hours but their full day rate is super reasonable  

- Reserve a sunken lounge experience at W Samui for a WooBar sunset session  

- Definitely hit Fisherman's Village night market (there is no official FB page or website)  

- While I went to The Jungle Club for a killer bloody mary and breakfast, my friend Terry who lives there says it's a top spot for sunsets so add it to your list for sunset sessions.  Call ahead and reserve a beanbag ;-)  

- ...and you should definitely take a half-day tour but the company I had contracted was so terrible I returned back to Mantra after only 2 stops so I can not recommend them.

FunFact! Bangkok Airways built the airport about 30 years ago and hand-on-my-heart it is the BEST small airport I have ever flown into or out of in the 32 countries I've visited so far.  It's charming and cute, the service level is exceptional, they have created a village feel to the departure zone, and there's a cool bar with a tiki hut vibe.  Check it out at the end of the video!

151,HMBQmTf-tsI,#1 Reason Your Travel Blog Will Fail (& ways to prevent it!),"#1 Reason Your Travel Blog Will Fail (& ways to prevent it!)

It feels like everyone now a days is interested in being in a travel blogger. Around the New Year, people get so excited and set all these goals for themselves. They think of a clever blog name, buy their domain, set up their wordpress and all that jazz,. After a few month, the excitement starts to fizzle, you're not as enthusiastic anymore. You're not seeing traffic to your site, or engagement, and then start wondering if you made a big mistake. You may start writing less and less, and just give up on it all together.

Let me ask you this. If you opened a restaurant or a brick and mortar shop, do you think you'd become profitable after a couple of months? You would have to have money saved up to pay ""rent"" because after all, it takes spending money to make money right? 

In this video, I‚Äôll talk about my #1 reason why most travel blogs fail (and no, it's not the lack of travel.)

157,GNVUWyvDiCM,"Family Travel Blog-Three Deaf Backpackers- My Heroes, Siem Reap, Cambodia","http://www.thenomadicfamily.com

So, slowly, slowly; we're unraveling a life together, you and I. I talk a lot, and you've become one hell of a great listener. I appreciate that. 

Anna (the younger one) in Peru spoke of her father's favorite poem. Something about how every man has his first kiss and his first snowfall, and it stuck to me, really snugly. And like you, I have mine. I have my stories that make me who I am, that create the fibers that define where I've been, that push me passed the pain to create who I want to be.

But, according to Buddhism, that 'me' is but only an allusion. Sakkaya-ditthi, personality belief, and it's what we hold onto, to help us define ourselves, label us, categorize and witness our own journey. But, Buddhism teaches that this false sense of self creates boundaries to spirituality and barriers to the true oneness with the world. It's 'me' 'my story' 'my pain' 'my life' and 'you'; likewise, I can stay flapping around lost in the winds of my own self, the way I was, who I was, who I am, who I will be- all false identities I use to mask my true, true non-self, anatta.

Of course, remember there's Gabi the traveler who is spiritual, and Gabi and spiritual who is traveling. I get confused. And, here too, ever so slowly, I'm learning how to differentiate them and know which articles to put here on thenomadicfamily and which ones at gabiklaf. So, if you'd like to learn more about spirituality, finding that peace and inner light, anatta (non-self) and ways to find her- go there to gabiklaf. :-) 

And our tale continues....

So, I have a story. And this blog allows me to share that with you, unraveling meticulously, one glorious string at a time, all the fibers that make me me. So, this is part of my story, my life-long fascination has always been deaf people. I fall in love with them, like I fall in love with people who work in book stores (Sheryl), librarians, Momma and Poppa old-fashion stores (especially with art and writing supplies), and firemen (but that's a whole different like of love, we don't have to get into right now). My entire life, I see someone signing and I'm stuck standing there, a bit too closely, with my jaw dropped and fairy dust parading before my eyes. A deaf person signing is the mute piped piper swaying his hands to the beat of the tune only her hears. He and me. 

So, it all starts like this. Kobi's sitting in the lobby of our hostel here in Siem Reap, Cambodia. He hands me a note (that I still carry in my notebook and look at every few days). It reads: 

""I saw your site, loved it. My friends and I admire you guys for what you all are doing. Keep up with the blog and continue to travel the world! ""

The note comes from Tandy Lewis, Shayna Unger, and Danielle Berrigan. Hand to heart, I look up. Kobi says, ""They're right over there,"" and I was lost in their music from that moment forth. Forget their kind ways, their shining faces and good looks, their interest in their fellow man, their ability to come right out and say kind things to encourage others; THEY ARE DEAF! That's it, deaf, deaf, deaf, and backpacking. 

OMG did my kids see mommy go into this strange metamorphosis. Years before we had kids and during a summer when (I can't recall exactly why) but I don't think I was working on the ice cream trucks; I enrolled in American Sign Language 101. It was an intensive 4-hour a day summer course. Walk in, day one, teacher is deaf. Here we go. 

So, sitting in the lobby in the middle of Cambodia, signing. I touched things that were precious and lost to me. A language I once knew, rather well. A language we had taught our three babies so that they could effectively communicate their needs before their mouth muscles knew how to voice words. We did baby sign in our home for years. 

And, remarkably fast, it came back. I was standing there talking to these amazing ladies, but not really, really there. I was somewhere else that I'd known long ago, but still can't define. I was in that silent world that somehow lights a voice in my soul that reveals a joy I do not know otherwise. It's a weird magic, and one I am grateful for the girls for bringing out again.

Now, Murphy would have it that during the absolutely most endearing (this one or debate ably the 'Angel Outside of Consumerist Hell') interview for me personally, the camera would shut off. So, you only see two minutes of six... Maybe that's meant to show me that my Sakkaya-ditthi, personality belief, is an allusion, just like my actually recording of this kick-ass, unreal interview was too. 


Enjoy it, and it's brevity. I did.

If you're looking for things to do in Buenos Aires Argentina, be sure to schedule a visit to La Boca. As long as you stick to the tourist path the area is completely safe, and busy as well. 

To skip the crowds arrive before the tourist buses at 10am. Although it's only when the shops open, the markets begin and the Tango dancers appear in the street you get the most from the La Boca atmosphere.

So... if Buenos Aires is on your South America route, whether you're English speaking or Spanish, La Boca is definitely a must see.",Travel Blogs
173,FXVZnPYLX8k,Langkawi | Casa Del Mar 5 Star Beach Hotel | Malaysia Luxury Travel Blog,"From the moment I caught sight of the charming architecture, the bold colours contrasting the blue sky, and my personal garden, I couldn't tell if I was Italy or Spain but somehow I was instantly transported back to the Med.  Then I turned around and my heart knew I was on the UNESCO World Geopark site of Langkawi, at the lovely Casa Del Mar.  This quaint five star hotel is home to just 34 rooms, making our stay an intimate affair where the staff remembers our usual order, knows our likes and dislikes, and instantly acts like we're part of the family.  In fact, this luxury property exudes such a chilled and relaxed vibe that I didn't fuss over how I looked once and simply relaxed throughout my entire stay.

Set on the pristine Pantai Cenang beach, Casa Del Mar Langkawi is just a quick 10 minute drive from the airport and with lots of shopping and dining all around.  The cosy feeling of check-in on overstuffed sofas begins the chilled experience you'll feel throughout your stay.

They have fun surprises like shelves upon shelves of books organised by language and a huge DVD library that you can simply walk up to and select what you'd like, which I did a couple of times and loved.

174,CjkRzSFck,Japan Travel Blog: Hakone Day Trip (From Tokyo to Hakone),"Visiting Tokyo? You don't have to restrict your holiday to just within the city, you can also take a day trip to Hakone from Tokyo via Train.

Make your way to Odakyu and purchase your tickets from the Odakyu Sightseeing Service Center. The tickets would include whatever you need for the entire day. 

To get to Hakone, you would have to take the train and change to an uphill tram, before changing to the Hakone Tozan Cablecar which 1st stop would be at Mt Hakone.

You would be able to take pictures with this active volcano, and also try their famous black eggs.  

Once done, hop back onto the cable car which would take you past a few stops including one that gives you a great view of Mt Fuiji on a good day. 

Continue on the cablecar till the end to reach the cruise center, where you would board thie gigantic cruise ship which would take you across lake ashi. 

Take a short stroll and embrace the beauty of the beautiful sakura trees found along the river. 

A short 15mins walk and you would find yourself at Hakone shrine. Drink from their famous 9 headed dragon basin, visit the fertility tree and also take pictures at the huge tori gate by the lake.

195,WMhkRzeGIMI,How to Be a Travel Blogger ‚Äî Creating Great Content,"This is the intro video for the course Being a Travel Blogger (Even When You're Not Traveling!). If you're a relatively new travel blogger or writer, then this course will help fill you up with inspiration and actionable tasks to fill up your editorial calendar. Learn more here: 

You don‚Äôt have to travel 365 days a year to be a travel blogger. Yup, seriously.

There are plenty of travel bloggers who enjoy a job that keeps them in one city most of the year...they prefer living close to family members...they are sorting out finances before making a move...or they only have 2 weeks of vacation a year. (Sound familiar? Sign up for the entire course here: )

Whether you aspire to one day travel every day of the year or you simply enjoy travel writing as a hobby, how can you successfully blog about travel when you‚Äôre not traveling? It‚Äôs a unique form of writer‚Äôs block to feel like you have no experiences or travel stories to write about simply because it‚Äôs been a little while since your last trip. But to be even remotely successful at travel blogging, you also have to be consistently publishing content. What‚Äôs a travel blogger to do?

Well, I‚Äôm here to help you kick that writer‚Äôs block's ass and get content and posts queued up in your editorial calendar. By the end of this course, you will have a plethora of different types of posts to create and different brainstorming techniques so that you can write regular content for your blog, no matter how much you travel. You simply have to know how to dig up that content and use it in the best way possible.",Travel Blogs

197,3PWt5O1CQ,Penang | Hotel Penaga Boutique Heritage in Georgetown | Malaysia Luxury Travel Blog,"From the moment I walked through the doors and into the eclectic mix of art deco d√©cor at Hotel Penaga, I could imagine what it must have been like back in the 1920s.  Lovely stained glass windows followed me as I walked from the bold geometric floors onto a natural footpath through flowering trees to the Transfer Suite.  This is a wonderfully restored luxury boutique property located just on the edge of the UNESCO protected world heritage site, in heart of downtown Georgetown.

Why You'll Love Hotel Penaga:
- Transfer Suites are quiet and charming, with wonderfully curated antiques inside and an open balcony perfect for sipping your morning coffee
- Cinnamon Restaurant and Bar is 100% for foodies.  I ate so well there, and enjoyed a few of the best lemongrass martinis I've ever sipped!  
- The location is perfect for exploring the historic areas of Penang

218,f6swkzQL4gY,First Time to Batam? Guide to Luxury Solo Travel,"Welcome to the complete luxury guide for all the best of what to do, eat, see, local wines to try, and where to stay on Batam. It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve visited an island that was so misunderstood that the tales of my adventures has surprised literally every single person I‚Äôve told! From a tourism standpoint, the island is at a turning point ‚Ä¶ expanding its offering to the new onset of global travellers and it‚Äôs really exciting. Batam and each of the six islands connected by bridges still feel mostly untouched by tourism and it‚Äôs a traveller‚Äôs dream. There is a ton to see, do, and eat and amazing spots to tuck in for cocktails-fuelled sunset sessions! Come along with me for 10 days as I explore Batam from head to toe and share the best of what I uncover.
    

All My Batam Videos:
Want to see longer versions of any of these recommendations? I have full-length vlogs for each place I stayed, Batamfast Ferry, the half day tour with Grab Rent, and more. You‚Äôll find them in my Batam YouTube Playlist üôÇ 

My Batam Recommendations

- Batamfast Ferry ‚Äì Request premium / business class or a private VIP cabin 

- Telkomsel 

- Rent a GrabCar for a half day tour 

- Galang Refugee Camp, referred to by the locals as the Vietnam Camp. You can find tons of details on their Wikipedia page


- ROCKOUT  is the wine distributor on Batam who turned me on to those yummy local Indonesian wines I tried from Sababay  and Two Islands 

- Anchor Cafe ‚Äì they roast their own beans and make hearty and dee-lish food (including homemade pastries!) 

- Kopak Jaya 007 kelong seafood restaurant is super Instagrammy and serves up top quality & killer views 

- Tempat Senang Resort & Spa ‚Äì friendly and relaxed, stay in the Madura Suite and don‚Äôt miss the private spa bath! 

- The Tempats ‚Äì Batam‚Äôs 1st and only private villa, with best price on alcohol and loveliest pool 

- Turi Beach Resort ‚Äì beachfront on a budget, with my favourite spot for a sunset session 

- Montigo Resorts ‚Äì stay in the 3 bedroom premium villa #3601 and don‚Äôt miss that all-natural facial (it was favourite spa on Batam)

A brief video (I was actually limited to three minutes) on the things to do and sights to see in Australia's capital in all but name.

This fantastic city offers the delights of any big metropolis, but it's biggest draw has to be the fact that it's blessed with gorgeous beaches. And they all come in all shapes, forms and sizes! I don't know if I get that across in this video! ;)

The other incredible thing about Australia, and what amazes me the most, is how young a country it is! Only 225 years old, and founded completely by convicts. England must have had an excellent crop of convicts at the time!

I wish I had more than 3 minutes, because there really is so much I left out on this video, but hopefully you get the idea of the amount of fun to be had in this city. I didn't even begin to cover Kings Cross! I'll leave that for the next video...",Travel Blogs

232,7Hk7PkV-Fb0,"Jubril Agoro ""How I Really Make Money "" Travel Blogging ?","People keep asking me this:

""Jubril, how do you make money and still travel the world?""

I haven't actually broke this down in a video before like I'm about to here so watch the video to learn exactly how I make money all while traveling the world at the SAME TIME...

Plus I'm having a free webinar where I outline exactly how I do it:
And you are invited, you can register for free below



Also, some things have really changed...
..and I want to update you on what is actually working right now so you can avoid the common mistakes most people make that wastes so much time and money...

The number one way I make money is:

#1 running Facebook Ads for myself as well as a handful of other business owners and marketers by doing exactly this:
I come up with the marketing material, write the ads, then run the ad campaigns for them.

This is by far the most profitable and believe me, most people think Facebook ads are difficult to get working...

But they're not...
You just have to know how to write them.

A perfect example is my client Tiffany...

...she is in the ultra-competitive finance industry.

Where companies usually pay $20+ PER Lead in most cases.

*I generate her leads on Facebook for 40 cents or less*
[We've generated tens of thousands at this small cost]
My secret?

Matching the right audiences together and HOW we create the ads... [which it seems NOBODY does like I do]

But there‚Äôs more...

#2 Travel blogging - some cool side income but the real benefit is the awesome perks like free hotel stays, free travel and 1st class upgrades.

All completely worth it... You could literally earn a few extra thousand bucks a month and travel lightly if that‚Äôs your thing. It can be that simple...

#3 Video Production - Shooting videos for our clients, interviewing them and adding some additional 'B' roll footage and background music.

[it's actually a lot easier than most people think with software that already comes loaded on your laptop in most cases]

#4 Affiliate Offers - This is a BILLION dollar industry by itself. It's by simply referring offers from companies that I like and use their products myself. Here‚Äôs how it works:

When I send emails about it and people buy the offer, I get paid. Its simple to do and no tech skills required for any of these ways I earn income really.

#5 Hosting & Speaking at Events - We can charge business owners up to 5K to come to a live, in person workshop where we teach them the simple things that we would normally charge to do for them.

Any of these can be learned much easier than you might believe...
Here is what you need to know:

Jon, a youtube marketer who works with business owners was losing thousands of dollars a month on Facebook Ads...

...he swallowed his pride and finally confessed this to me...
...then I taught him a few basic Facebook Ad strategies, and a year later...

Over million dollars in revenue.

So to get to the point... Do you want me to teach you what I showed Jon how to do as well as my other clients?

If so, I'm holding a free training webinar where I will be revealing the exact strategies I taught Jon.

Plus, if you sign up for the free webinar, the moment you sign up I‚Äôm going to immediately redirect you to a training video that shows you...

...what I showed Nathan, my kiwi student... who now generates 5 figures every month and travels the world full time... with a full time income.

You can get all of that right here:


[Make sure to get on the list for the free webinar as well]

If you have any desire to start a business online from scratch or learn how grow your business with Facebook ads then you need to be on that webinar.

I'll see you there,

25 Things to do in Madrid, Spain | Top Attractions Travel Guide Travel Video Transcript:

Hola y bienvenidos a Madrid. This week we are in the Spanish capital and we are going to show you twenty five of the best things to do in the city.  

Final thoughts on your time in Madrid. Well, I really enjoyed the city. And I really found that it is super walk-able. We were here for 10 days and we hardly had to take the metro at all. We just took the bus once when we were visiting the stadium but the rest of the time we were able to walk wherever we needed to go. And also I think it is a great city for art lovers. There are so many galleries and museums to check out. And a lot of them are free in the evening. So keep that in mind.

And now it is your turn. What did you think of Madrid? You know what? I absolutely loved Madrid. It is a city that just really clicked with me. We have a lot of friends that are living here long term and prior to coming here I had no idea like why would someone want to come to Madrid? Now I totally get it. I love the culture, I love the food, I love the nightlife. Everything is really cheap. I go to the grocery store and I can get a one liter thing of wine for just over a Euro. It is just a really affordable fun city to be in. And it is somewhere I hope I have a chance to come back to again soon.

And that is a wrap of our time in Madrid! We had a splendid time and were truly sad to say goodbye to the city, but that just means we'll have to come back again. If you have any travel tips for Madrid, feel free to share those in the comments below.

This is part of our Travel in Spain series.  We're making a series of videos showcasing Spanish culture, Spanish arts, Spanish foods, Spanish religion, Spanish cuisine and Spanish people.  

All photos and video taken by Samuel Jeffery (Nomadic Samuel) and Audrey Bergner (That Backpacker).

245,06T2kabkL7E,Top Places in France: Alsace | Expedia Viewfinder Travel Blog,"Alsace is a famous region in north eastern France that‚Äôs been producing wine for centuries. Lauren LeBrun from the Expedia Viewfinder blog shows us why it‚Äôs one of the best areas in France for wine tasting and village hopping. 

The region stretches across 40,000 acres and more than 100 villages. Riquewihr is a town in central Alsace that dates back to medieval times. Being there makes you feel like you‚Äôve traveled back in time! Walk down the cobblestone streets and you‚Äôll see timber-framed, brightly-painted buildings. The architecture has been carefully preserved throughout the centuries, so it appears almost identical to how it looked in the 1500s. The town is packed with restaurants, shops, and wine tasting rooms. Here you‚Äôll find local favorites such as tarte flamb√©e, French crepes, and fragrant cheeses. 

But one of the main reasons why people visit Alsace is to wine taste. The region is known for its Riesling wines, which are actually drier than other Rieslings produced around the world. Go to any village on the Alsace wine route and you‚Äôll be able to taste a variety of wines from family owned vineyards. If you love food, wine, and charming villages, then Alsace is the perfect place for you. Cheers to your next vacation in France!

How do bloggers make money?

I love, absolutely love reading about success stores of people starting a website, putting in the hard work for years and building wealth for themselves while producing a lot of value for everyone else.

This video is based of this Reddit post: 
The website in question is: 

Practical Wanderlust is a site that knows what it is. Practical travel advice, a little bit of story telling and a whole lot of work to make travel content that is insanely helpful. In the post she breaks down how she make money from blogging.

As someone who loves to travel, I sincerely appreciate the design and work ethic she has put into her blog. Anyways, enjoy the video :)

How do bloggers make money from blogging?

Her main sources of income are advertising at over 3k a month as well as professional writing gigs at 3k a month. This is followed up by affiliate marketing for another 3k. Of this affiliate marketing, about half is from Amazon and the other half are various other programs.

This one is about our train trip from Jakarta to Yogyakarta. As you already know, our budget is more than limited, so we decided to buy the cheapest tickets. We were surprised that traveling vy train in Indonesia (Java Island) is much more expensive than traveling by train in Thailand.

260,9FhhHe2eay8,Singapore | Marina Mandarin Executive Club | Asia Luxury Travel Blog,"When it comes to Marina Mandarin Singapore by Meritus, you definitely can't judge a book by its cover.  The outside of the building is unassuming, leaving us insanely unprepared for the jaw-dropping awe you'll experience stepping through into the beating heart of this lovely property.  If you're lucky enough to arrive during the day, you'll be greeted by songbirds whose tunes echo throughout the hotel because all 21 floors open onto an immense atrium.  The staff are friendly and charmingly dressed, the rooms are large, and if you couldn't imagine staying in Singapore and not having the best view ... well, you're in luck because Club Rooms like mine come with a balcony and that iconic view of Marina Bay.

Why You'll Love Marina Mandarin Singapore:
-- Dim Sum Lunch at Peach Blossoms - the restaurant serves up some of the most diverse and inventive dim sum dishes that I've seen in Singapore.  There's a set all-inclusive menu and an √† la carte menu with some really interesting extras like lobster and foie.  OHHH and my favourite part is that they serve bottles of Champagne and have a fab list of sakes and wines, which is not common at most dim sum lunch hotspots. 
-- The Views!  Come on, we all want that stunning skyline view of Singapore and Mandarin Orchard has the best view of Marina Bay Sands and the areas around it, including the ferris wheel.  Just wait 'til you see it at night.
-- Meritus Club Lounge - I've been a huge fan of Meritus Club since I first stayed at Meritus Pelangi Beach Resort on Langkawi last year but Marina Mandarin really stands out.  They basically won my heart by serving Mo√´t & Chandon champagne and some of the most interesting cheeses during the Club's happy hour!

271,_-JOV5RzbTQ,Riga (Latvia) Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Riga in Latvia.
Riga is the capital of Latvia, a Hanseatic city and European capital of culture. Saint Petri Church is located in the centre of the city and has a long and varied history.  It features inner cross vaults modelled on those of the dome of the Hanseatic city of L√ºbeck‚Äôs cathedral, plus a circular arch and sturdy, red brick walls.  It is one of the most important sacred buildings of the Middle Ages and is closely linked with the development of the city. Mentzendorff House was a manorial property which German merchants had built at the end of the seventeenth century.  Carefully renovated, its original splendour has been fully restored. The middle class buildings of Elisabeth and Albert Street indicate the prosperity of its past occupants.  Like almost nowhere else, art nouveau has been preserved incredibly well with lavish embellishments and numerous motifs. Marien Cathedral is situated in the centre of the city and is the most important religious building in the Baltic States.  Its age, dimensions and contrasting architectural styles bear witness to a long history and its famous organ, built in 1883, contains a hundred and twenty four registers and almost seven thousand wooden and metal pipes. In keeping with the age-old traditions of the Hanseatic League, the very heart of the Baltic beats within Latvia's metropolis and, with an elegant lust for life, Riga is an extraordinary treasure!

Mookambika is Shakthi devi, the supreme mother goddess in Hinduism. She is worshipped in three different forms such as Maha Kali (goddess of power) in the morning, Maha Lakshmi (goddess of wealth) in the noon and Maha Saraswati (goddess of knowledge) in the evening. There are bus train services from Byndoor Udupi and Mangalore to Kollur at regular interval.
Mythology holds that at the Kollur Mookambika Temple lived a demon named Kaumasura, who unleashed terror upon the gods by the special powers he obtained from Lord Brahma. While the gods were trying their best to stay away from him, good news came that the demon would face death. Learning of his impending doom, Kaumasura undertook severe penance. Lord Shiva appeared, asking the demon what boon he would like to be granted. Sensing that grave danger would come of the demon if his boon was granted, Saraswati, the goddess of speech took away his ability to speak. Kaumasura came to be known as Mookasura or the mute demon. Thereafter, the supreme mother parvati devi, the goddess of power, mobilized all the powers of the gods and killed the demon, and hence she came to be known as Mookambika. The place where Mookambika killed the demon came to be known as Marana Katte.

The establishment of the Mookambika temple is attributed to the Supreme, Lord Parameshwara sadashiva, rather than to an individual person. Historically, the temple is estimated to be at least 1200 years old and is mentioned in conjunction with king Halugallu Veera Sangayya who installed an idol there.

As a legend goes, Adi Shankara, the much revered spiritual leader from Kerala, once offered intense worship to Saraswati, the goddess of wisdom and learning. The goddess appeared before Shankara in response to his prayers. Shankara told her of his wish to have her come along with him to Kerala, where no temple was dedicated to her as yet. Goddess Saraswati agreed to go with him on the condition that Shankara must lead the way for her to follow, without doubting her and not looking back even once to check if she was with him. Should he break the condition, she would stop and stay right where she was at the time. Shankara agreed to the condition. So they started walking down the Kodachadri hills, with Shankara leading the way and goddess‚Äô anklets tinkling and letting him know that she was with him. After walking some distance, the tinkling stopped all of a sudden. Shankara waited a few moments and stole a quick look backwards to find the goddess still with him, watching him with reproach. In keeping with the condition, the goddess stopped right there. Shankara, however, was not one to give up. He apologized profusely for breaking the condition and repeatedly begged and pleaded with the goddess to go with him to Kerala. Impressed by his determination, the goddess finally agreed to be present at the Chottanikkara Temple in Kerala in the mornings and return to the Mookambika temple by mid-day.",Travel Blogs

I love travel blogging I have had a travel blog for 3 years now. It is even in my name... Joe Travel Blogs. But it is always so exciting at the start getting to create a new blog from scratch. It is a chance to recreate your own identity! But the problem is you only get to do that once. 

SO I decided I would help my friend Jack to create his own travel blog for when he goes travelling later in January. This way he gets a chance to share his travels if he wants to and I get the enjoyment of creating a travel blog from scratch again! Surely that is a win for both of us! 

Later on in the video we also head off to Puzzlewood for a little travel vlog! In order to get some great pictures to fill out his blog! Keep watching till the end for that :)

But thank goodness I did because it let me uncover this amazing jewel in Singapore, that is literally the closest 5 star hotel luxury property to Changi Airport with a sky bridge that connects guests to the departures terminal.  Crowne Plaza Changi Airport even has a brand new wing that is ulta chic and retrofitted for the business traveller, with tons of international charging bays for all of our equipment and devices.

Why You'll Love Crowne Plaza Changi Airport:
- The rooms are modern and cosy and come equipped with personal phones that allow guests to call 11 countries completely free of charge.
- The hotel is connect to Changi Airport!  I mean, how much closer can you get and still be pampered and play in a gorgeous tropical pool while sipping Champagne?
- The Club Lounge is bright and cheery and serves up a fab brekkie and happy hour.

294,Z7sBsE5kwA,üé• Sri Lankan Cooking - Pol Sambol - Food Travel Blog - Sri Lanka Vlog - Coconut Sambol,"One of several videos we filmed while in Sri Lanka, this video vlog was shot just outside Negombo. Pol sambola (coconut sambol) is a traditional Sri Lankan dish made from coconut, mostly used as an accompaniment with rice, string hoppers, hoppers, and many more meals. Sri Lankan cuisine has been shaped by many historical, cultural, and other factors. Foreign traders who brought new food items; influences from Indonesian cuisine and the cuisine of Southern India have all helped to shape Sri Lankan cuisine. Today, some of the staples of Sri Lankan cuisine are rice, coconut, and spices. The latter are used due to Sri Lanka's history as a spice producer and trading post over several centuries. Kottu is a spicy stir-fry of shredded roti bread with vegetables. Optional ingredients include eggs, meat, or cheese. It was invented in Batticaloa and literally means 'chopped roti' in Tamil. Hoppers (appam) are based on a fermented batter, usually made of rice flour and coconut milk with spices. The dish is pan-fried or steamed. The fermenting agent is palm toddy or yeast. Hopper variants can be either savory (such as egg hoppers, milk hoppers, and string hoppers), or sweet (such as vandu appa and pani appa). Kool is a seafood broth from Jaffna containing crab, fish, cuttlefish, prawns, and crayfish. It also contains long beans, jak seeds, manioc, spinach, and tamarind. The dish is thickened with palmyra root flour. ""Short eats"" are a variety of snacks that are bought by the dozen from ""short eat"" shops and restaurants. These are eaten on the go, mainly for breakfast or during the evening. Short eats include pastries, Chinese rolls and patties. A popular short eat among Tamils is the mutton roll, made from tender pieces of mutton with potato and seasoned with spices. This can be a very spicy dish. Mutton rolls are served all over the world wherever there are Sri Lankan Tamils.  -  -  -  -  -  -  - ",Travel Blogs

‚òÖ  How I Got Started

Hi, I'm Amber and in May 2017 I started this nomadic journey after selling my house and all my belongings to pursue this crazy dream of living out of my RV full-time and traveling all around North America.

After 1 year of traveling, I sold my 26 foot Winnebago Class C RV for a more nimble Class B Hymer Aktiv van. I couldn't have been more excited to continue my second year in a van that allows me to travel to more places and experience more in life.

With smart design choices such as a strong neck, back and sides made of ABS, the 0 nut, compensated saddle, solid geared tuners, and a rounded back makes this travel ukulele a serious instrument with a great tone.  

Come join me as I test out the Flight TUS35 on a hot day on the boat to see if it withstood the hot temperatures and the great outdoors.  Thank you to my Instagram followers that gave me some amazing questions to answer about the Flight TUS35.  I play several ukuleles side by side so that you can compare the tone to other ukuleles made of different tone woods.  CORRECTION!  The graphic for the Grace VanderWaal Signature ukulele was cut off.  It has a glossy finish to look like walnut, but it is laminate sapele.

Debbie Woodward, Saucepan Kids Travel Blogger and United Airlines have teamed up to bring you this excellent family travel video. Showing you the best Chicago family activities, Chicago family restaurants and attractions. Enjoy Chicago with kids starting with your business class united airlines flight.



- - Okay, kids in Chicago, we'll you've gotta make sure that you're in the center so that you can walk to all the great family-friendly attractions that are in the center of Chicago. I would say two that you really have to check out, if you're here in Chicago with your kids would be Wrigley Field, that baseball game. Never been to one before, it's so exciting the atmosphere is electric, the kids will love it. Also, I would say Navy Pier, that's iconic really and there's so much for kids to do, you'll be there for the day. Business class with United was amazing, it was such a treat, it was so luxurious and there was so much space. I was blown away by the comfort of the bed when it lay flat, I didn't think I'd sleep but I really did, and the Egyptian cotton bedding was gorgeous. The food was incredible and it just kept coming, there was so much of it and really good quality, not what you expect from airplane food, so that's fabulous. Well worth it. Definitely check out Lou Malnati's, which is the really famous Chicago deep dish pizza joint. A couple of locals recommended it, and I can see why. Great experience, great fun for the kids, really family friendly. And I would say, for a slightly quirky restaurant and still kid friendly is The Purple Pig. I really enjoyed that restaurant, there was a great menu available, surprising. The Dana Hotel, super modern, uber-cool and chic hotel right in the center of Chicago. We were able to walk to everything from the Dana Hotel, really comfortable. Great meal in there actually, we had a nice meal in there as well. And the rooms had everything, everything from gorgeous towels to yoga mats, to huge widescreen TV, coffee machine, everything you could need.",Travel Blogs

351,35reI2AqbrM,A Day In The Life Of A Travel Blogger,"Join me at Big Berry in Slovenia as I show you what a day in the life of a travel blogger can look like. 

'Can' is a crucial word - every day is different when you're a travel blogger. It's one of the things I love most about working as a travel blogger, but it does mean there's no 'typical' day. 

In this day in my life video, I'll show you what a day on a press trip look likes. Press trips are a common part of the travel blogger lifestyle, but just like the job itself, every press trip is different. 

This press trip is at a resort called Big Berry. It's on the Kolpa River in Slovenia and is a luxury resort for relaxation. That means this blogging trip was a lot more relaxed than usual! On this day, my main goal was to experience the resort and the Big Berry ethos, as well as making sure I had enough photos for the blog post I will be writing. 

In this vlog, I used the Canon M50, Canon 5D iii and DJI Mavic Air drone. Here's a full list of cameras and gear I use for blogging: 

As always, thanks for watching! I hope you enjoy this insight into a day in the life of a travel blogger - even if there's no such thing as a 'normal' day in this career!",Travel Blogs

Honestly, how does one decide which tea to sip when the selection is so beautifully mixed? Well, why sip just one when I could be naughty and try four? So I did. That, and indulge in an awe-inspiring selection of savoury and sweet treats that turned this High Tea into the highlight of my week!

Why You‚Äôll Love Afternoon Tea at The Ritz-Carlton Kuala Lumpur:
- The food is to-die-for delicious. I don‚Äôt have a single complaint or even note from my visit, it was all perfect
- A quartet in white tuxedo jackets plays the prettiest music you can imagine ‚Äì from iconic 50s love songs to popular songs playing on the radio today. Think Breakfast At Tiffany‚Äôs meets Taylor Swift. They made the ambiance perfectly magical
- Their exclusive tea blend is named ‚ÄòThe Ritz-Carlton Kuala Lumpur Blend‚Äô and it is a mix of Chinese Tie Kuan Ying (tea served to royalty since the Tang dynasty) and green Oolong that is smooth and creamy, and smells of white flowers to me. I loved it!
- They serve fruit infusions for those looking to avoid the caffeine kick
- TIP for Vegetarians (or anyone with special dietary needs): You will LOVE their VIP service! Call 2 days prior to your visit and the chef will create a personalised afternoon tea menu just for you

Alessandra had organised the excursion with Mr Hanspeter who speaks French, German and Italian but I am pretty sure those only speaking English could manage too. From her description, we built up a picture of him being similar to the uncle in the story Heidi and expected to be a bit intimidated by him.

In fact, Mr Hanspeter was one of my favourite people ever!!  He explained a bit about how to handle the llamas (not much to it really, just that they don‚Äôt like having their ears touched and that we should try and stay in front of them. Jude was handed his own Llama to manage named Capuccino, I had Fabrizio, Jean had Nikolai and Alba was sagely reserving her judgement! :-).

Pol sambola (coconut sambol) is a traditional Sri Lankan dish made from coconut, mostly used as an accompaniment with rice, string hoppers, hoppers, and many more meals. Sri Lankan cuisine has been shaped by many historical, cultural, and other factors. Foreign traders who brought new food items; influences from Indonesian cuisine and the cuisine of Southern India have all helped to shape Sri Lankan cuisine. Today, some of the staples of Sri Lankan cuisine are rice, coconut, and spices. The latter are used due to Sri Lanka's history as a spice producer and trading post over several centuries. Kottu is a spicy stir-fry of shredded roti bread with vegetables. Optional ingredients include eggs, meat, or cheese. It was invented in Batticaloa and literally means 'chopped roti' in Tamil. Hoppers (appam) are based on a fermented batter, usually made of rice flour and coconut milk with spices. The dish is pan-fried or steamed. The fermenting agent is palm toddy or yeast. Hopper variants can be either savory (such as egg hoppers, milk hoppers, and string hoppers), or sweet (such as vandu appa and pani appa). Kool is a seafood broth from Jaffna containing crab, fish, cuttlefish, prawns, and crayfish. It also contains long beans, jak seeds, manioc, spinach, and tamarind. The dish is thickened with palmyra root flour. ""Short eats"" are a variety of snacks that are bought by the dozen from ""short eat"" shops and restaurants. These are eaten on the go, mainly for breakfast or during the evening. Short eats include pastries, Chinese rolls and patties. A popular short eat among Tamils is the mutton roll, made from tender pieces of mutton with potato and seasoned with spices. This can be a very spicy dish. Mutton rolls are served all over the world wherever there are Sri Lankan Tamils.  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - Roti (also known as chapati) is a flatbread originating from the Indian subcontinent, made from stoneground wholemeal flour, traditionally known as atta, that originated and is consumed in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Maldives, Malaysia and Bangladesh. It is also consumed in parts of South Africa, Fiji, Mauritius, the southern Caribbean, particularly in Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Grenada, Barbados and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Its defining characteristic is that it is unleavened. Indian naan bread, by contrast, is a yeast-leavened bread. A kulcha in Indian cuisine is a bread-like accompaniment, made of processed flour (maida) leavened with yeast. The word roti is derived from the Sanskrit word ‡§∞‡•ã‡§ü‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ (ro·π≠ikƒÅ), meaning ""bread"".[4] Names in other languages are Hindi: ‡§∞‡•ã‡§ü‡•Ä; Assamese: ‡ß∞‡ßÅ‡¶ü‡ßÄ; Nepali : ‡§∞‡•ã‡§ü‡•Ä; Bengali: ‡¶∞‡ßÅ‡¶ü‡¶ø; Sinhalese: ‡∂ª‡∑ú‡∂ß‡∑í; Gujarati: ‡™∞‡´ã‡™ü‡™≤‡´Ä; Marathi: ‡§™‡•ã‡§≥‡•Ä; Odia: ‡¨∞‡≠Å‡¨ü‡¨ø; Malayalam: ‡¥±‡µä‡¥ü‡µç‡¥ü‡¥ø; Kannada: ‡≤∞‡≥ä‡≤ü‡≥ç‡≤ü‡≤ø; Telugu: ‡∞∞‡±ä‡∞ü‡±ç‡∞ü‡∞ø; Tamil: ‡Æ∞‡Øä‡Æü‡Øç‡Æü‡Æø; Urdu: ÿ±ŸàŸπ€å; Punjabi: ‡®∞‡©ã‡®ü‡©Ä,‡®´‡©Ç‡®≤‡®ï‡®æ; Thai: ‡πÇ‡∏£‡∏ï‡∏µ. It is also known as maani in Sindhi, ruti in Bengali and phulka in Punjabi and Saraiki. In Sri Lanka, probably the most popular type of roti is pol roti (coconut roti), made of wheat flour, kurakkan flour, or a mixture of both, and scraped coconut. Sometimes, chopped green chillies and onion are added to the mixture before cooking. These are usually thicker and harder than other roti types. They are usually eaten with curries, or some types of sambol or lunu miris and considered a main meal rather than a supplement. Another variety of roti popular in Sri Lanka is Kottu roti. Kottu roti is made up of paratha or godamba roti . Paratha/godamba roti is cut into small pieces. These pieces are small in size and rectangular or square in shape. Then on a square heating pan, vegetables, onions are allowed to be fried. Then eggs, cooked meat or fish are added to fried vegetables and allowed to be heated for a few minutes. Finally the pieces of cut paratha is added. All these ingredients are mixed using two square pieces of steel. A peculiar sound is deliberately made while the mixing is done[citation needed]. It is said that the first person who innovated kottu roti to save the remaining paratha at his restaurant made this noise to attract patrons to make them aware of the new delicacy[citation needed]. Depending upon what ingredients are used, there are vegetable, egg, chicken, beef, mutton and fish kottu roti.",Travel Blogs

374,zSHcyXfNP,Iceland Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"With a population of only 300,000, Iceland can feel like the most isolated place on earth, yet its capital Reykjavik, is only a three-hour flight from London and just under six from New York.
 
Reykjavik is relaxed and welcoming, yet possesses a cultural life that holds its own against other European capitals. Most buildings are built simple and low to beat the North Atlantic winds. However, the city is also graced with grand civic architecture inspired by Iceland‚Äôs natural beauty, such as the soaring central tower of Hallgr√≠mskirkja.
 
Many of the country‚Äôs most popular sights are within easy reach of Reykjav√≠k. Immerse yourself in the spirit of Iceland, at the Blue Lagoon. Then spend a day or two in The Golden Circle, an area which encompasses three of Iceland‚Äôs greatest natural wonders; Thingvellir National Park, the Geysir Geothermal Field, and Gullfoss.
 
Iceland‚Äôs main ring road strings together an endless series of epic landscapes. Less than two hours drive east of Reykjavik are two of the world‚Äôs most beautiful waterfalls, Seljalandsfoss and Sk√≥gafoss. Continue eastward towards V√≠k, Iceland‚Äôs southern-most village, where you‚Äôll find the dramatic landscapes of Black Beach, Reynisdrangar, and Dyrholaey. Follow the ring road for another two hours into the ethereal light of J√∂kuls√°rl√≥n Lake, where icebergs break away from Europe‚Äôs largest glacier and float for years before tumbling out to sea.
 
Head north and feel the earth rumble at Europe‚Äôs mightiest waterfall, Dettifoss. Then explore the Myvatn region, a tranquil lake surrounded by nature in all its violent beauty. Take a careful walk through the boiling landscape of Namafjall, lose yourself amid the lava pillars of Dimmuborgir, and peer into the caldera of Krafla Volcano.
 
Known as the Capital of the North, Akureyri is the perfect place to warm up and enjoy some creature comforts, before heading off into the wilds again. In Iceland, every side road is a story waiting to unfold. So come, and live your own Icelandic story, it‚Äôs one you‚Äôll keep telling for the rest of your days.

We decided to start our Travel Blog, livelaughtravelnet, as we traveled more frequently, to log our adventures and share our travel tips. But even after we broke up, I realized that that didn‚Äôt make me love traveling any less and I decided to continue on my quest to experience this world alone.

But NO, for the record, I am not professional nor am I a full time traveler. I'm born and bred in Singapore, one of the most expensive cities in the world, and becoming a full time traveler comes almost impossible to any of us.

Today,  I'm (The Food Ranger, Trevor James)  bringing you in DEEP for a FULL ON street food tour of Peshawar, Pakistan. Peshawar is one of the oldest market towns in the world and has one of the richest street food scenes you'll ever witness! You need to travel to Pakistan!

We're going Foodrangin' for tons of FAMOUS Pakistan Street Food - including the AMAZING BBQ Nisar Charsi Tikka Kababs, some amazing UNSEEN Pakistani Pulao, and ULTRA RARE PIZZA NAAN!!

You will fall in  love with the street food in Peshawar as soon as you arrive! Today, we're starting out with an UNSEEN Pulao, found in downtown Peshawar in the old area where there is street food everywhere! Here, it was full of basmati rice and huge chunks of beef and huge beef bones with unbelievably delicious bone marrow!

After this, we're going Foodrangin' and finding some local street stalls before going to Nisar Charsi Tikka BBQ Mutton HEAVEN!

First, we found a local Pakistan street food served right on the street, the fruit chaat! It was a delicious fruit salad topped with a rose syrup! This was amazing, but what was even more delicious than this famous food in Pakistan is the Pizza naan we found next!

After tasting  the fruit chaat, we walked down a local alley in Peshawar that was full of delicious Pakistani street food, like mutton kerahi (sometimes called Karhai) and fried street fish!

We found one of the most unique street foods in Pakistan, the Pizza naan! It was loaded with tomato, coriander, potato mash, and sliced potato! It was quite salty and was delicious!

After this, we made our way to Namak Mandi in Peshawar to visit the super famous and ultra unique Nisar Charsi Tikka! But first, we found a home cooked Pakistani street food, the Saag! Here, it was served with lassi and also Pakistani corn bread! It was so unique!

And for our final meal, we went to the WORLD FAMOUS Nisar Charsi Tikka! Here, we met the LEGEND himself, Mr. Nisar Charsi! Here, you can get huge BBQ kababs and also delicious Mutton Kerahi! It was  so amazing to taste!!!

I hope you're enjoying this big Pakistani street food video series! Thanks so much for watching, I would love to hear from you down below!

I have always liked this place with the usual (and unusual) range of retail outlets, it's clean and bright and very accessible.  Later this year a new food hub will be opening that will certainly add value to it. One wonders how the rest of the town will be impacted but the Management seem genuinely honest and open about two way working with the retailers whether outside or inside the mall. 

Opening in 1973 the uniqueness was three fold: 1) a unique black and white tiling to the then single storey  2) the delivery area located on the roof, which removes the need for lorries to enter the pedestrianised sections to unload.   3) shops have a unique outward/street facing frontage.

My visit was interrupted by security as I was told that I needed permission to film.  Subsequently I had a meeting with Jane Stewart about this and future plans for video blogs.",Travel Blogs

406,riKithVcuI4,MY AUDIO BLOG: FIRST TIME TRAVEL TO SINGAPORE | D-DAY @ CHANGI INTL AIRPORT,"This is my first time making an Audio Blog/Audio Diary for my travel. I never imagined making this kind of blog on YouTube since it's not as common as Vlogs, but I'd be happy if I could give any little help to Filipinos (or from other countries of course) who travel first time to Singapore  - especially from Davao Intl. Airport to Changi Intl Airport. I'm a starting YouTuber and I love making and editing, and doing voice-over on videos. I hope you appreciate my effort in making this, and if you do, please give me a thumbs up and subscribe. I'd try my hardest to make high-quality Audio Blogs and Vlogs (when I can afford) in the future.

This is the first part of my Singapore Series Audio Blog. I traveled (for the first time abroad) there last year in March 2018, and I had the greatest time in my life. I was in a tight budget and my friend there offered me a place t stay  - little did I know, it was a big deal in passing the immigration interview. I almost got offloaded, but eventually I got on the plane! I'd like to keep this memory forever so even I didn't intend to make any blog about it, I found myself writing this and now making this video.

Thank you so much guys!

Every afternoon tea is unique, but they all follow a general template. It includes three tiers of goodness. The first is full of savory sandwiches. The top two tiers have sweets like cupcakes, scones, lemon squares and raspberry marshmallows.

423,1n2QV6Yjl,Penang | The Edison Heritage Boutique Hotel | Asia Luxury Travel Blog,"'Hell yeah' is pretty much the response you'll hear from me anytime I realise that the heritage hotels outnumber the large five star hotels in a city.  I absolutely adore them.  And The Edison joins the list of my favourite hotels in Penang because they have perfectly renovated their glorious property into a modern heritage hotel that respects its historic architecture yet embraces today's trends in comfort and style.

Why You'll Love The Edison
- The Edison is chic, charming, and classy.  It is bright and welcoming during the day, and romantic and assuring at night.
It sits in the heart of downtown Georgetown, located next to two of my all-time favourite spots in town: Red Garden -- a local street food pavilion with live music nightly -- and the lovely Spanish tapas and wine bar Georgetown Wines
- The Lounge is open 24 hours and serves up complimentary snacks and refreshments just like a VIP Executive Club.  And the coffee there is GREAT!

I was almost not allowed to leave the country and it cost me an extra $700 USD while I fought to get on the plane. 

In this travel hacking video blog I tell you how to get around booking a round trip ticket to Costa Rica to get your 90 day visa. Costa Rica has tightened their borders so expats do not overstay their visa and airplanes will not let you get on the plane without a return ticket. You can also book the Transnica Bus or TicaBus for very cheap to exit the country. 

Check out the problems JetBlue gave me almost causing to miss my flight, but I beat the system.

435,UmF5il2bl8g,üé• Sri Lankan street food - Kottu Roti - Hoppers - Food Travel Blog - Sri Lanka Vlog Street Food,"üé• Sri Lankan Cooking - Kottu & Hoppers - Food Travel Blog - Sri Lanka Vlog Street Food One of several videos we filmed while in Sri Lanka, this video vlog was shot just outside Negombo. On our last night before moving on we stopped at a Kottu Hoppers place, you can hear in the video of this the incredible noise that is made when making Kottu as the two large scrappers hit the hotplate and chop the roti with vegetables and spices. Well that was our time in this villa, amazing. So in the morning we take a 3 hour drive east to Kandy, see you when we arrive. Kottu is Roti or a type of flat bread chopped with a sauce of some kind added in the mix. The sound of kottu being made really is the background music of Sri Lanka. Cooks chop out on a hot flat griddle the roti and then add in pretty much whatever you can think of. Chicken curry, Vegetable curry and so on are popular. As the cooks hit the griddle with what looks like big scrappers, the sound of metal on metal fills the air. We pulled up outside a Kottu house and ordered from the car. Chicken and Cheese was our choice and it was brought over as we sat in the minivan. Plenty of fresh chilli and crispy chicken soon left my plate and i am now ready to go back to the hotel, feeling totally satisfied with my day. See you in the morning. Hoppers (appam) are based on a fermented batter, usually made of rice flour and coconut milk with spices. The dish is pan-fried or steamed. The fermenting agent is palm toddy or yeast. Hopper variants can be either savory (such as egg hoppers, milk hoppers, and string hoppers), or sweet (such as vandu appa and pani appa). Savory hoppers are often accompanied by lunu miris, a mix of red onions and spices.Short eats are a variety of snacks that are bought by the dozen from ""short eat"" shops and restaurants. These are eaten on the go, mainly for breakfast or during the evening. Short eats include pastries, Chinese rolls and patties. A popular short eat among Tamils is the mutton roll, made from tender pieces of mutton with potato and seasoned with spices. This can be a very spicy dish. Mutton rolls are served all over the world wherever there are Sri Lankan Tamils.
Kottu is a spicy stir-fry of shredded roti bread with vegetables. Optional ingredients include eggs, meat, or cheese. It was invented in Batticaloa and literally means 'chopped roti' in Tamil.  -  -  -  -  -  -  - 
Pol sambola (coconut sambol) is a traditional Sri Lankan dish made from coconut, mostly used as an accompaniment with rice, string hoppers, hoppers, and many more meals. Sri Lankan cuisine has been shaped by many historical, cultural, and other factors.",Travel Blogs

450,GkLn9jJcupU,"BEIRUT TRAVEL BLOG | LADIES MEET UP | FOOD, VIEWS, PARTIES","Trip with my Girls to Beirut.

We have been Best Friends for over 7 years now. Since we met we have gone through the best and the worst of times together. I believe his friendship was sent from heaven because my angels are flawless people and greatest friends. 

We have lived together in London and one-day circumstances have changed and we were separated, London, South of France and Dubai... so we needed a place to meet, bond and catch up on our lives. 

Lovely Maria has suggested Beirut as our destination. Not knowing much about that place other than its middle east with the unstable political situation and Syrian war next door we jumped on it :) And right we were! 

Beirut turned out to be a beautiful place fool of culture, art and greatest food. Best designers, couturiers and artists have come from Lebanon and Beirut is the hub.

The food is amazing, we have had Lebanese and Armenian food that was insane. There is no place like Lebanon if you like Arabic food. Fool of flavour and love in every bite.

I haven't shown the grand luxury scene of Beirut because we were in offseason and also no one really cares :) But if you do, Beirut has a massive Yacht bay just off city centre with insane skyscraper hotels and luxury apartments overlooking the bay area with Hermes, Dior, Gucci and Couture Dress designer boutiques like you've never seen before with gold embroidered dresses in the window displays. If that's your vibe, then it's definitely a place to visit.

We have made a pact to come back to Beirut and explore more of Roman Empire racks, Bazars, Skiing resort and famous pine nut forest that is a symbol of Lebanon and reflected on the national flag.

I would love to share knowledge about this beautiful place when we are there next time. But for now, enjoy the snippets of our trip and a photo slideshow.

I really hope me and my Girls will have many more of these trips and we will be able to share it with our friends and spread the good vibes.

1)  Our first day in Sofia we hit the ground taking in many street performances, getting caught up in a football mob / rally, visiting major landmarks and eating street food.  These are our first impressions of Sofia.
2)  Already impressed by Bulgarian street food, we decided to treat ourselves to a sit down meal to further sample Bulgarian cuisine.  At Lubimoto we feasted on Chushki Burek (stuffed red peppers with feta cheese) and Bulgarian pork loin with potatoes, cheese and gravy.  Both were delicious!
3)  Wanting to indulge our taste buds further we visited the ever popular Made In Home restaurant where we sampled Rakia and goat cheese salad.
4)  On our last day in Sofia we tried to cover parts of the city we didn't get to visit on previous days.  Some of the highlights included checking out Alexander Nevsky Cathedral and witnessing more street performances.  Those Bulgarian break dancers really do have all the moves!

Becoming a professional travel blogger takes skills and a solid business attitude.  And - it takes time to get to the point of actually making some money, or a decent living of it.

A number of skills must be mastered for Travel blogging:

1) you need to become and excellent writer - and I mean: blogging style, which is very different from regular writing. Blogging is more like a conversation with a good friend over a cup of coffee than an article in the New York Times.

Short paragraphs, easy on the eye, kolloquial phrases and an engaging style are keys to reach an audience in the internet world.

There are numerous resources for good blog writing training that teach you how to become a travel blogger and the best one is a guest blogging course mentioned in this link, 

Guest Blogging is also a great way to build a following which brings us to our second point of important skills to master as a professional travel blogger:

2) Building a large following, both blog subscribers and very importantly on Social Media.

Without a substantial following sponsors and travel boards will not be interested in collaboration with a Travel blogger, because there is no potential for them to market their products, hotels etc.


This also includes mastering the art of ranking high in Google: SEO
Ho to become a Travel Blogger also includes an understanding of how to structure and article, how to perform keyword research, how to set up your travel blog etc - and you need to start from day 1 because Google ranking usually takes months to show any results, especially for a brand new travel site that still needs to build authority and credibility with google. SEO Video course:

SEO 1 - 
SEO 2 - kw - 
SEO 3 - OnPage - 
SEO 4 - OffPage -  

3) You must become a budget travel ninja - know how to travel for free, get paid to travel, get cheap air tickets etc


Most importantly, you need to understand that becoming a professional travel blogger means becoming an entrepreneur. You are building a business and a brand and that takes time, mastering new skills and iron determination.

Most travel bloggers fail at monetizing their blog in any significant way, because they never bother to learn and master the skills necessary and they are not really serious or understand that a professional travel blog is a business - and not a hobby.

As an example of a great - and immensely successful - travel blog check out  - one of the absolute top blogs in the world with hundreds of thousands of followers. It also includes a number of excellent post on how to become a travel blogger.

But don't worry - they, too, didn't start big, they build their brand over many years and became experts and entrepreneurs and eventually reached these heights - and you can, too.

The London Underground is a masterpiece made up of 12 lines that stop at 270 stations in 6 zones. Most tourists will probably stick to Zones 1 and 2, so pay for your tickets accordingly. 

3 Ways to Pay for Tube Fare:

1. Travel Card - This is a disposal paper ticket that can be valid for a day, a week or even more. 

2. Oyster Card - This is a plastic prepaid card that you can put money on and pay as you go. It costs ¬£5, so don't forget to return it when your trip is over. You'll get back the ¬£5 and any remaining balance. 

3. Contactless Credit Card - If you have one of these cards, you can use it at the security barriers to tap your way in.

499,kTLLxlbSR,World Travel Blog Episode 40: Hiking Moanalua Valley Trail to the Haiku Stairs (Stairway To Heaven),"The Ha ªik≈´ Stairs, also known as the Stairway to Heaven or Ha ªik≈´ Ladder, is a steep hiking trail on the island of O ªahu, Hawaii.[1] The total 3,922 steps span along Oahu's Ko'olau mountain range.[2]


The view from the top of the stairway overlooks Kaneohe as well as Kaneohe Bay.

Early morning view of Kaneohe from the stairs.
Beginning in 1942, contractors for the United States Navy began construction of the Ha ªik≈´ Radio Station, a top secret facility that was to be used to transmit radio signals to the Navy ships that were then operating throughout the Pacific.[3] In order to obtain the necessary height for the antennae, the Navy stretched them across Haiku Valley, a natural amphitheater surrounded by high ridges. To accomplish this, they needed ‚Äúeasy‚Äù access to the top of the ridges, so they installed a wooden ladder up the mountain. The ladder was later replaced by a wooden staircase. Once the cable car was in operation, most workers preferred to ride the car to the upper hoist house rather than enduring the tedious climb up the stairs. Some remnant parts of the wooden ladder may still be seen beside the metal steps.

The radio station was commissioned in 1943. To transmit such a powerful signal, the Navy needed a transmitter of greater capability that was then possible with vacuum tube technology. They therefore decided upon an Alexanderson alternator, a huge device capable of generating powerful low-frequency radio signals, and requiring an antenna of heroic proportions.[3]

When the Naval base was decommissioned in the 1950s, the United States Coast Guard used the site for an Omega Navigation System station. In the mid-1950s, the wooden stairs were replaced by sections of metal steps and ramps ‚Äî by one count, 3,922 steps. 

In 2003, the stairs were repaired, costing the city $875,000.[4] As of early 2018, land usage rights issues have not been resolved. The City and County of Honolulu has stated that there is currently no plan to open the stairs for public use, citing liability concerns, although it has been noted that the mayor is vocally open to reopening the stairs under his circumstances. Dozens of people, however, routinely hike up the stairs every day; there's at least one video of such hikes posted online.[5] In August 2012, Don Tiki show singer and comedian Fritz Hasenpusch died of a heart attack during his Haiku Stair climb.[6] As of November 2017, a guard is still posted at the base of the stairs.",Travel Blogs

Lauren LeBrun from the Expedia Viewfinder blog takes us through the breakfast market in Warsaw, Poland to give us a taste of what markets are like in Europe. 

In Warsaw, tons of vendors sell all sorts of different dishes at the breakfast market. Walk around the stalls and you will find fresh produce, homemade products like cheese, and plenty of treats. One of the desserts you can find is the traditional Polish dessert called racuchy. It‚Äôs similar to an apple pancake. The dish is made by rolling apple slices in flour, dipping them in a thick batter, and frying them in oil to make them nice and crispy. It‚Äôs absolutely delicious! Stop by the Vegushka stall for the best racuchy.

Surin beach
Surin Beach is another jewel of Phuket. Stunning sea views, just like the picture. Nice sand. During low season, huge waves, but in the high season certainly recommend a visit. The beach is ideal for youth recreation, parties are held here and rest guys from around the world.

Over the summer, my family spent a few days at Woodloch Pines and I have to be honest with you  ‚Äì we had the most incredible time ever. Woodloch Resort has become one of our favorite family vacations to DATE. 

There is something truly special about Woodloch Pines. And you know what? I can tell you what it was. Woodloch Pines offered up simplicity.  There was an old-school mentality. A trip to those mountains became everything that I wanted my family to experience and more‚Ä¶ and I cannot wait to return.

525,7uY0Ab5HlZ0,Toronto Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Toronto.d17831...

Welcome to Toronto, the largest city in Canada and a hub of trade and culture.

‚ÄúThe City That Works‚Äù is full of a can-do spirit that is reflected in its buildings. From the famous CN Tower to the castle-like Casa Loma, there‚Äôs all sorts of eye candy for the architecture enthusiast. Your Toronto tour should include a trip to Edward Gardens in Hyde Park, or one of the many other green spaces located in the city. Take a bike ride along the trails, or enjoy a picnic while the local chipmunks look on. Don‚Äôt drop anything; they‚Äôll grab it.

Your Toronto sightseeing can continue at the Harborfront Center. Go for a walk along the marina, or grab a pint at a brewhouse. And no trip to Toronto is complete without a visit to the Hockey Hall of Fame, so make sure you‚Äôve got your team paraphernalia in order before you venture inside. Looking for shopping? You‚Äôll find the Underground City and Kensington Market ready to welcome you and your credit card ‚Äì or several credit cards, as the case may be. After a day of madcap purchasing, why not stock up on fresh, healthy food at the St. Lawrence Market? You‚Äôll have worked up quite an appetite for delicious local produce. 

Before you leave, head to Niagara Falls and take in the spectacle of nature‚Äôs power. You‚Äôll never forget the sight and sound of all that water pouring over the falls, nor will you ever forget your trip to Toronto.

üé• Sri Lankan Street Market - Food Travel Blog - Sri Lanka Vlog - Street Food - Local market in a small village just outside Negombo. Every village has a market day, lots of dried fish and fresh vegetables. One of several videos we filmed while in Sri Lanka, this video vlog was shot just outside Negombo. Pol sambola (coconut sambol) is a traditional Sri Lankan dish made from coconut, mostly used as an accompaniment with rice, string hoppers, hoppers, and many more meals. Sri Lankan cuisine has been shaped by many historical, cultural, and other factors. Foreign traders who brought new food items; influences from Indonesian cuisine and the cuisine of Southern India have all helped to shape Sri Lankan cuisine. Today, some of the staples of Sri Lankan cuisine are rice, coconut, and spices. The latter are used due to Sri Lanka's history as a spice producer and trading post over several centuries. Kottu is a spicy stir-fry of shredded roti bread with vegetables. Optional ingredients include eggs, meat, or cheese. It was invented in Batticaloa and literally means 'chopped roti' in Tamil. Hoppers (appam) are based on a fermented batter, usually made of rice flour and coconut milk with spices. The dish is pan-fried or steamed. The fermenting agent is palm toddy or yeast. Hopper variants can be either savory (such as egg hoppers, milk hoppers, and string hoppers), or sweet (such as vandu appa and pani appa). Kool is a seafood broth from Jaffna containing crab, fish, cuttlefish, prawns, and crayfish. It also contains long beans, jak seeds, manioc, spinach, and tamarind. The dish is thickened with palmyra root flour. ""Short eats"" are a variety of snacks that are bought by the dozen from ""short eat"" shops and restaurants. These are eaten on the go, mainly for breakfast or during the evening. Short eats include pastries, Chinese rolls and patties. A popular short eat among Tamils is the mutton roll, made from tender pieces of mutton with potato and seasoned with spices. This can be a very spicy dish. Mutton rolls are served all over the world wherever there are Sri Lankan Tamils.  -  -  -  -  -  -  - ",Travel Blogs
532,WPpzhWSE6ng,Family Travel and Sailing Blogs about Exploring the World by Sea and Living your Dream,"Our new CHANNEL AD.!

A decade of planning, saving and sacrifice to eventually live the dream of traveling the world by sea.  We sold all our belongings, quit our jobs, rented the house, took the kids out of school and searched for the best cruising boat we could afford, before we were finally ready to go sail the world's oceans.

Our family vlogs tell the story of the amazing people we meet, the strange places we visit and the travel and adventures we have along the way. But they are also about the everyday trials and tribulations of trying to live off-grid, of remote working, making money as we travel, shopping, cooking, boat maintenance, home schooling, living on a budget and the everyday challenges of family life afloat.

We'd love you to SUBSCRIBE to our channel and SHARE our adventure with friends and family who might just need that little nudge to step outside their comfort zone to live their dream too.. and perhaps learn a little from our mistakes!

538,Xp516Bc3PvA,Travel in Guatemala,"Travel in Guatemala with Macca and Brianna as they took to the streets of Antigua, climbed to the top of Pacaya, take in the national park at Semuc Champey, and walk among the ancient ruins at Tikal.

If you enjoyed this action packed travel adventure in Guatemala, check out An Adventurous World -  - and subscribe for more videos like this one -

Guatemala is a bit of a favourite amongst backpackers with nothing but good times to be had, as Macca and Brianna found out for themselves.

In this episode our delightful duo dance their way through the small streets of Antigua, climb to the top of a mighty volcano, splash around at Semuc Champey, and walk among the ancient ruins at Tikal.

All of this made Guatemala the team's favourite country they've travelled to so far.

Next up, we're going to two of the least visited countries in Central America - Honduras and El Salvador.

539,Azw7vz60zr,The Ritz-Carlton Kuala Lumpur Staycation Spa Weekend | Malaysia Luxury Travel Blog,"Whether you‚Äôre looking for a spa and foodie weekend ‚Äòstaycation‚Äô or a fabulous hotel to call home during your holiday or business trip to KL, The Ritz-Carlton Kuala Lumpur is going to be just what the doctor ordered. Located just 2 kilometres away from the iconic Petronas Towers, The Ritz is a haven of pampering for both the body and soul. Their newly renovated rooms opened only a few months ago but I swear I felt like the first guest to stay in mine (it was utterly pristine) ‚Ä¶ and with attentive butler service, I rarely wanted to leave it. Foodies will love The Ritz because you‚Äôll find something to tempt you day or night between their five diverse restaurants and lounges, with hands-down the best jellyfish in their fine dining Cantonese restaurant Li Yen that I‚Äôve tried in my life.

Why You‚Äôll Love The Ritz-Carlton Kuala Lumpur:
- The service! I‚Äôve been reviewing 5-star hotels since 2011 and this is the first time I‚Äôve listed ‚Äòservice‚Äô as the #1 love but it‚Äôs true. It doesn‚Äôt matter where I go in the hotel, because I‚Äôve been here a couple of times before (for afternoon tea and once for Sunday brunch) the staff not only knows what I like and brings it without asking but they all magically seem to greet me by name ‚Äì I love that!
- The 1-bedroom suites are bright and modern and so absolutely perfect you'll want to stay IN on this visit to KL.
- The food!  Lordy, lordy the fooooood!  I ate so much, and so well, that I left with a couple extra kilos I'm sure.  Don't miss their afternoon tea (my #1 favourite of the big hotels so far in Kuala Lumpur) or the Menu Du Jour for dinner in The Library, it was my favourite meal of the weekend.
- Champagne 'Sunday Roast' Brunch!  It's a grown up brunch, without donuts or waffle stations, and it's scrumptious.

https://www.facebook.com/IrelandTravels
https://twitter.com/TravelsIreland

Ireland travel is about taking a journey into the magical.  While taking a tour of Ireland you should always include time to travel West Cork.  You can experience more of the West Cork area at my Ireland blog using the links above.

Whether you are walking the paths of the many parks, climbing the rocky hills, fishing from the rugged coastline, sitting on a sandy beach, taking photographs of the Irish countryside or cycling the winding roads; a tour of this scenic area of southwest County Cork, Ireland is a must.

Begin your tour at Mizen Head, Ireland's most southwesterly point.  The dramatic peninsula features Barley Cove beach and is highlighted by the Mizen Head Signal Station Visitor Centre.  Be sure to look for seals lazily resting on the rocks below.

On past the village of Crookhaven you will find yourself on Streek Head, a remote area accessible only through rolling Irish countryside and pastures.  This is a beautiful place to watch the sun rise from or set into the Atlantic Ocean.

Near the quaint village of Skibbereen is the area of Lough Hyne.  Lough Hyne is a salt-water lake, fed by the tides, and is home to a varied collection of marine life.  Above the lake are the walking paths of Knockamagh Wood Nature Reserve, which is part of Ireland's national park system.  The paths of the nature preserve lead you to commanding views of Roaringwater Bay, Baltimore harbor and Clear Island.  A picnic is fantastic way to finish this walk.

Further up the coast, near the County Kerry border, is the fishing village of Castletownbere. The village is situated on the southern edge of the Beara Peninsula and is near the beginning of the southern portion of the Ring of Beara.  Just out of town are the ruins of Dunboy Castle, which was destroyed by the English in 1602 after a 14-day siege.

Priest's Leap is also located near the County Kerry Border and overlooks the world famous Bantry Bay.  Irish legend holds that a priest, while riding a horse and fleeing soldiers, jumped from this point and landed many miles away near Bantry.  

Looking for a place for fishing in Ireland?  The pier at Toor Point has commanding views of the Atlantic Ocean and Toor Island.  A lazy, quiet afternoon can be spent watching the waves crash against the shoreline as the seagulls soar above you.

Between the villages of Goleen and Durrus, you will find the Coast Road.  On this road is the well-preserved O'Mahoney Castle known as Dunmanus Castle.  The castle was built in 1430 at the current location of Dunmanus Harbor.  Views of the beautiful Irish countryside and Dunmanus Bay will have you reaching for your camera.

Possibly the most beautiful place in all of West Cork is Three Castle Head.  The collection of three towers, built in 1207 by the O'Mahoneys, is a short hike from Dunlough Pier.  The castles sit on cliffs, which offer views of the Atlantic Ocean, Mizen Head, Sheep's Head and the mountains of County Kerry.  At the base of the castles is a lake.  Irish legend holds that a lady haunts the lake, while protecting the king's valuables that were thrown into the lake to guard them from attackers.

Planning your next vacation to Ireland?  Don't forget to tour West Cork.

557,MEle9Vfxoh0,Maui Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"As the second-largest island in the Hawaiian chain, Maui is home to less than 150,000 people. It makes up for its sparse population by drawing more than 2.4 million visitors per year, all of whom are drawn to its sparkling beaches, warm water, and lush tropical habitats. 

Polynesian and modern American lifestyles blend together in the Valley Isle. Maui‚Äôs legendary greenery, sprouting from fertile lava soil, has made it a popular place for hikes and scenic drives. Of course, its fascinating culture and history are also huge draws. Once you‚Äôve arrived on the island, your Maui tour should kick off with the capital city, Wailuku, which is full of museums, pubs, and places to explore. 

Maui is not a large island, and in theory it‚Äôs easy to see all of it‚Äîafter all, you can drive from one end to the other in less than three hours. Instead of taking the shortcut, though, do some Maui sightseeing around the perimeter. Rent a car and pull onto the Hana Highway, where you can view some of Hana‚Äôs beautiful, secluded spaces, like the Garden of Eden Arboretum. You can enjoy its stunning views of the ocean and bamboo forest for hours.

Once you reach the other side of Hana, you‚Äôll find Haleakala National Park, which is set on a dormant volcano. If you go hiking there in the morning, you‚Äôll see a brilliant sunrise and truly understand why Haleakala means ‚Äúthe house of the sun.‚Äù 

But who are we kidding? You‚Äôre here for the beaches‚Äîand there are 80 of them. Whether you want to go snorkeling in the crystal clear waters of Molokini Island Preserve or commune with the turtles at Maluaka Beach, you‚Äôll find the perfect watery habitat on Maui. If you want to learn how to surf, Kihe is the ideal place; with its gentle waves and affordable lodgings, you‚Äôll be getting barreled in no time.

From ancient culture to modern beachcombing adventures, Maui truly has it all. What kind of adventure will you have?

FAQ:

- Can I use this music in my videos?

To use this music in your videos or media projects, you must first purchase a license from the link above. You can then show that you have rights to use the music should you receive a copyright claim or if you plan to monetize your channel. This is very important as it will prevent any possible strikes against your YouTube channel or videos.

- Doesn't royalty-free music mean I can use it for free?*

'Royalty-free' music is not the same as 'free music'. Unfortunately, this is a common misconception on the internet, and especially here on YouTube.

Simply put, it means that royalties don't have to be paid to the creator each and every time it's used (ie. free of royalties); but instead, a one-time fixed fee is paid, which is via a license purchase. This gives you the rights to use the music and is also how I earn my living and feed my cat! :)

- Do I have to buy a license for every video I make?

No, you only need to purchase one 'regular' / standard license in order to use it in all your videos on YouTube, forever. If you wish to use another song, then you'll need to purchase another license for that song. 

- Can't I just give you credit in my videos, instead of buying a license?

Unfortunately, no. Just giving credit to me in your videos doesn't protect you from copyright infringement in accordance to international law. A license is required to show YouTube that you have the proper rights to use my works on your videos, which is also needed if you looking to become a YouTube partner and monetize your videos.",Travel Blogs

Tomislav Perko, 29, is a travel writer from Croatia. After a career of a stockbroker, broke because of the financial crisis, he hits the road and turns it into his home. He uses alternative ways of traveling ‚Äì hitchhiking, couchsurfing, working/volunteering, and manages to wander around the world with just a little bit of money in his pocket, meeting the most amazing people on the way.

Five years later, he publishes a book ‚Äú1000 Days of Spring‚Äù and goes around giving lectures about what it means to live on the road. Find out more on his website: .

This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",Travel Blogs

ABOUT US
Hi, we‚Äôre Chris and Mandy, travel bloggers and creators from Australia. Since December 2015, we have been travelling and exploring the world full-time. We usually spend 1-2 months in each place we travel to and love really getting to know a place. One of our favourite ways to get to know a destination is through food, and we share all of our food guides here on Youtube and on our travel blogs. We love to pack light, travelling the past 3 years with carry-on only. On AlmostLanding.com, we share in-depth guides to help you plan the best trip, we often have free printable guides you can download or print out, we‚Äôve created our own travel maps pinpointing our favourite picks for different places so you can easily find everything and make travel planning easy. We have another travel blog all on Bali, AlmostLanding-Bali.com, we‚Äôve spent so much time in Bali and share everything we know and love about this beautiful island. We‚Äôve fallen in love with travel and blogging, and we wanted to create a space for other travel lovers and life dreamers. Thanks for being a part of Almost Landing, and make sure to say hi :)",Travel Blogs

What You Shouldn't Do When You Are in Italy 
Visiting Italy is an amazing experience whether you are seeing the Roman ruins throughout the country in places like Rome or Naples, but for all the amazing things you should do in Italy (visit Venice, Florence, Rome, Ravenna, Amalfi Coast, eat until you explode) there are things you DON'T DO when you come to Italy & Here are our 12 things NOT TO DO in Italy when you are traveling Italy. 
Filmed in Vicenza, Italy
Copyright Mark Wolters 2016

The Don'ts of Italy
1. Don't expect to get discount prices on fancy Italian luxury brands. 

2. Don't eat near tourist sights. You will be ripped off and not get as good of Italian food as you would away from the tourist sights. 
 
3. Don't Tip. They already charge you for service. 
4. You Don't have to scream louder to get people to understand you. 
5. Don't worry about overdressing, the Italians will always look better than you.
6. Don't just visit Rome and Venice, there is so much more to Italy. 
7. Don't share your pizza and make sure you do eat it with your fork and knife.
8. Don't use the fast trains for short distances, they are not worth the significantly higher prices. 
9. Don't expect to see spaghetti and meatballs on the menu TOGETHER. They will be there separately, but not together. 
10. Don't expect a big breakfast in Italy. Just coffee and a cookie. 
11. Don't overpack. You will be limited on space when traveling in Italy so pack accordingly. 
12. Don't expect to be served food in a restaurant between 3pm and 7pm.

583,gzmCgxaiRZU,Osaka Travel Tips: 10 Things to Know Before You Go to Osaka,"Things YOU need to know before you travel to Osaka Japan. Osaka is the third most populated city in Japan with 2.7M  in the city and 19 Million in the region. Osaka is often overlooked for Tokyo and Kyoto, but Osaka has its own charm that makes it a wonderful destination for visitors.  Osaka is a welcoming, exciting, and place that should really be on your travel radar!

Osaka is located on the main island of Honshu, roughly in the center of Japan.  Osaka is a great place to base yourself when visiting Japan. In the centre of the Kansai region, landing at it‚Äôs international airport will place you within an hours local train journey to Kyoto, Nara and Kobe.  Osaka is worth worth 3-5 days.

2- Food

Osaka is famous in Japan for their food. Its nickname is ‚Äúthe nation‚Äôs kitchen‚Äù. 
Most well known: okonomiyaki, which is a dish made with meat, seafood, and noodles. 
Takoyaki, delicious fried octopus balls that are sure to curve your hunger cravings at night.

Kushikatsu. Kushi refers to the bamboo skewers that the food is on and you can find meat, vegetable and even cheese varieties here. Don‚Äôt forget to dip your fried goods into the tonkatsu sauce (but strictly NO double dipping)

And of course Ramen!

Osaka is home to 200+ Michelin starred restaurants and Dontoburi is the epicentre of that.

Aside from the delicious food, Osaka is also well known for its high quality Sake, or Japanese rice wine. The sake is made from fresh water that comes from the Osaka mountains

3-Kita (Umeda) North District

One of 2 major districts in Osaka
Newly rebuilt JR Osaka station is the heart 
Business and lots of Hotels
Grand Front Osaka is amazing

YenTenjimbashi-suji Shopping Street
This 2.6km covered shopping arcade is the longest in Osaka

Umeda Sky Building is one of the tallest and most impressive buildings in Osaka. It‚Äôs more like two buildings connected by a bridge at the top. There‚Äôs a great observation deck at the top called the Kuchu Teien (‚ÄúGarden in the Sky‚Äù) Observatory.

HEP 5 Ferris Wheel - 500


4- Minami (Namba) South District
Osaka‚Äôs 2nd downtown 
Neon lights,  crazy signs
Japan's version of Times Square
Shinsaibashi and Namba

Dotombori Arcade runs parallel to the canal on the south side and it‚Äôs lined with some of Osaka‚Äôs most famous and largest restaurants, which compete for business with huge signs and giant mechanical crabs etc.

Midosuji (shopping street)
Osaka‚Äôs ‚Äúmain street,‚Äù Midosuji is a broad street All the major international luxury brands have outlets here

Hozenji Yokocho (traditional alley)
Two small blocks east of Midosuji and two small blocks south of the Dotombori Arcade, you‚Äôll find one of the most beautiful streets in all of Osaka and it looks like it was magically transported from somewhere in Kyoto. Entering this street is like slipping 200 years back in time. 

Doguyasuji Arcade (kitchen and cooking supply shopping arcade)
About five minutes‚Äô walk southeast of Namba subway station (easily reached on foot from Dotombori

Amerika Mura (trendy district)
Amerika Mura (or ‚ÄúAmemura‚Äù to the locals) 

5- Otaku Paradise

Den Den Town. Osaka‚Äôs answer to Akihabara and not far from Namba station, here you‚Äôll find all the weird and wonderful Japanese toys and manga you‚Äôve heard about on the internet. Watch your step or you could unintentionally fall into adult-only territory. (Or intentionally, if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre after.)

Den-Den is the city‚Äôs electronics, camera, computer and pop culture shopping neighborhood. It‚Äôs about 10 minutes‚Äô walk southwest of Namba Station, in Nippombashi, running roughly between Nippombashi and Ebisucho stations on the Sakaisuji subway line. Many of the shops here have someone on hand who can speak English, so don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for help when looking for something.

599,r0BU69XajsQ,Manila's BEST Street Food Guide - FILIPINO FOOD in Quiapo + Binondo | Street Food in The Philippines,"FIRST TIME IN THE PHILIPPINES!! Street Food Guide to Manila 2019!!!

We are teaming up with FoodieMommaPH (her channel: ) to bring you an entire street food series in Manila, Philippines! Today, Khee will be showing us the food and culture of Old Manila, around Quiapo Market and the oldest Chinatown in the world: Binondo! Thank you so much to FoodieMommaPH for making our trip in the Philippines unforgettable! She will be joining us for our entire MANILA STREET FOOD series, so go check out her channel!!!
 
We start our morning in front of Quiapo Church and try a classic street food style breakfast called taho, silken tofu, drizzled with brown sugar syrup and topped with tapioca pearls (1 cup 20 php/0.38 usd). Served out of a mobile bucket warm and fresh! Continuing through the market, Khee shows us some of her favourite childhood snacks. We stop to have some banana-cue, deep-fried bananas covered with brown sugar (15 php/0.29 usd each) as well as hot cakes (5 php/0.10 usd each) which are smothered in butter and sugar and served PIPING hot! So yummy, sweet and CHEAP!

Still hungry, we head straight for Chinatown in the heart of Manila to try some Filipino/Chinese specialties. Our first stop was to Dong Being Dumplings, an old ‚Äúhole-in-the-wall‚Äù shop where dumplings are made fresh on site! We ordered 1 serving of their special pork dumplings (200 php/3.83 usd per plate). The ladies were whipping these dumplings up at record-breaking speeds! The dipping sauce was sour from vinegar and spicy from the chili oil. Delicious! 

We then went deep into the Chinatown market to eat lumpia, the Philippines spring roll (70 php/1.34 usd each)! The wrapper is soft and holds together all of the delicious, and flavourful ingredients inside. Served fresh and with a side of chopped garlic for a full on FLAVOR BOMB! 

Next up, we found a rare (bicycle) stall serving binatog (20 php/0.38 usd each). Binatog is a sweet dessert made up of boiled corn, coconut flakes, and sugar. There are salty versions too! It is a very unique food that we‚Äôve never tasted before! 

Next we try a Cantonese/Filipino steamed and fried bun called Siopao. We ordered several sweet pork buns (22 php/0.42 usd each) and ate them fresh street-side, and even more to take home for later! We finished our street food craze at a local institution, Barrio Fiesta, for halo-halo, to cool off and satisfy our sweet-tooth! We ordered the halo-halo special (170 php/3.26 usd) with bright purple ube (purple yam), candied fruits, jellies and MORE! 

Thanks so much to FoodieMommaPH for showing us the incredible Quiapo Market and Chinatown in Metro Manila! Follow her for more Filipino street food and local eats in and around Manila!

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù & finally decided we wanted to travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this YouTube channel to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling! So we extended our 1 year trip to now FOUR years :) Now we have a goal of traveling to 100 countries before 2020! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)",Travel Blogs
603,_sMsw6vHvxE,South Korea Trip STARTS NOW! | Korean Barbecue in Seoul eating Samgyeopsal (ÏÇºÍ≤πÏÇ¥),"Come join us for an exciting new travel and food series as our South Korea trip starts now! We kick things off with an epic Korean barbecue in Seoul eating delicious Korean pork belly known locally as Samgyeopsal (ÏÇºÍ≤πÏÇ¥).

David's Channel: 

My trip to South Korea without Audrey begins in Toronto's Pearson International Airport where I grab a quick burger before boarding my direct 13 hour + flight with Air Canada to Incheon. Upon arriving in Seoul I check into my hotel and enjoy a quick dinner with some of the other YouTubers. The rest of the night is all about Korean barbecue.

David, having not tried Korean barbecue before, loved the Korean pork belly samgyupsal. Aside from the delicious meat it was the side dishes and especially the spicy salad and samjang sauce that tickled our tastebuds. After dinner we grabbed some Korean craft beers before calling it a night. Overall, it was a fantastic night in Seoul and a great beginning to our Korean trip together.

A special thanks to the KTO (Korean Tourism Organization) for making this vlogging trip to South Korea possible.

South Korea Trip STARTS NOW! | Korean Barbecue in Seoul eating Samgyeopsal (ÏÇºÍ≤πÏÇ¥):

Hey guys! We are Samuel and Audrey, a vlogging travel couple from Canada. In this travel channel we share our travel and food vlogs while touring the world.

Our most recent trip was to South Korea where I embarked upon a two-week adventure without Audrey. Invited as part of a YouTube vlogging trip, organized by KTO, I spent the first week traveling with other YouTubers in Seoul, Busan and Gyeongju. My second week included independent exploration of Korea with my good friend and fellow YouTuber David of DavidsBeenHere. 

Having lived and traveled in South Korea, the chance to return to one of my favorite countries was one of the biggest surprises of 2019. On this particular trip, I had an opportunity to do many things I had not previously covered including a visit to the DMZ (Demilitarized Zone between South Korea and North Korea), a Buddhist Temple Stay and a Korean cooking class. It was almost as if the program designed by KTO knew exactly what I had missed out on before.

Obviously, a huge highlight from the two weeks I spent revisiting Korea was the food. I feasted on all of my favorite Korean dishes including Korean barbecue, dolsot bibimbap, haemul pajeon, tteokbokki, bulgogi, kimbap and many others. I can honestly say that Korean food is world-class and is one of my top 5 favorite cuisines in the world. Aside from trying familiar dishes, I had the opportunity to sample raw Korean seafood for the first time.

While visiting Seoul, highlights included going to Gyeongbokgung Palace, Namsan Seoul Tower, Jogyesa Temple and Hongdae. As one of the biggest cities in the world, I barely scratched the surface of things to do in Seoul.

Spending extended time in Busan was my favorite part about the trip with top highlights including a Korean temple stay, fresh fish markets and a Korean baseball game. It was from Busan that we ended up taking a day-trip to Daegu where we enjoyed a traditional Korean market and tried Galbi-Jjim for the first time.

If you want to see more videos from Korea in the future, let us know in the comments what places you'd like us to travel to and what food experiences you'd like to see on this travel channel. 

Have you traveled to South Korea before? What was your experience like? Please share your Korea travel tips, advice and experiences in the comments below.

‚úà‚úà‚úà

After feeling refreshed and rejuvenated from the beautiful beaches of El Salvador, Macca and Brianna got back to doing what they do best ‚Äì backpacking around and experiencing all a country has to offer, this time in Nicaragua.  

Nicaragua came with the tag as being a bit of a favourite amongst other travellers, so Macca and Brianna we‚Äôre extremely excited to see what it had to offer and whether it lived up to its reputation for themselves.

What they discovered was a country of unparalleled beauty, kind and generous people, and enough adventure activities to keep any adrenaline junkie happy.

In this episode Macca and Brianna try out volcano boarding for the first time, hike to the top of El Hoyo before swimming in a crater lake, spend a night on the tiles in San Juan del Sur, even manage to pick up a new travelling companion, before finishing off zooming around the island Ometepe.

In the end, Nicaragua truly lived up to its reputation, and it quickly became one of our favourite countries in the whole world. Next up, we went to go and see what Costa Rica had to offer.

627,29cZyKgtqI,ROBBED IN MALAYSIA - Langkawi Seaview Hotel Review,"We got robbed in Malaysia while staying at the Langkawi Seaview Hotel. We never thought it would happen to us while traveling Malaysia and we are so upset. Help us bring awareness to the worst hotel in Malaysia by sharing this video! Here‚Äôs the full robbery story on what happened on Langkawi Island:

Our robbed in Malaysia story starts like this: we arrive in Langkawi Malaysia and check into our hotel. Instead of seeing what was pictured in the beautiful pictures, we are greeted with a insect infestation and mold. It was like being on a dirty hotel rooms episode. Staying in Kuah Langkawi, we sacrificed location on Langkawi island to get what the hotel said was great wifi, a beautiful new renovation, and a comfortable stay.

Instead of enjoying our time in Langkawi Malaysia, we ended up being tourists getting robbed in broad daylight. Our housekeeper went into our room and performed hotel robbery while we were downstairs eating breakfast. She stole $350 USD from Stacia‚Äôs wallet and rifled through all of Ryan‚Äôs belongings. We never expected there to be any theft in Malaysia because everyone we have encountered so far has been incredible friendly. Not only did we get robbed in Langkawi, but the hotel fought us to avoid refunding our stay when we insisted on cutting our stay short.

Unfortunately, we had to cut our visit to the islands in Malaysia short because of this devastating event at the Langkawi Seaview Hotel. This is definitely not one of our most fun travel stories in Malaysia, but we are happy to share it with you guys so you can avoid the same fate. Stay tuned for more, happy Malaysia travel vlogs and don‚Äôt forget to subscribe. We will see you guys in the next video, seeya!

* We‚Äôre Ryan & Stacia from DeathbyVlog. Unlike other travel vloggers, we live and work in a different country each month. Our channel will show you what it‚Äôs like to live abroad while exploring top tourist destinations and hidden gems. We will eat local cuisine but still find the best spots to have American food while overseas. Each month we rent an apartment or airbnb in a different city or country, so follow along on this journey and learn about countries around the world. We hope you enjoy our travel vlog, don‚Äôt forget to subscribe!

628,6VYB3a9bbiA,24 CRAZY SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS YOU`VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE,"We have a lot of things stored in the kitchen, with which you can put interesting experiments for children. And for yourself to make a couple of discoveries and wonder why you never noticed this before? 
One of the most interesting experiments you can do at home is elastic eggs! You have no idea how that's possible? It's easy! This experiment is a classic example of an acid base reaction. This reaction dissolves the shell, but leaves the inner membrane intact, creating a bare egg.
Put the egg in a glass jar. Add vinegar. Pour enough vinegar to cover the egg, and a little more. First the eggs swim, but then they sink.
Watch the bubbles! Within a minute of adding vinegar, tiny bubbles of carbon dioxide appear on the eggshell. This is one part of the chemical reaction that takes place inside the jar.
Close the lid and leave for a few days, and can be a week. The egg will get a little bigger. The brown color of the eggshell pales. A layer of scale appears on the surface of the vinegar. You can replace the vinegar in a couple of days.
After a week, carefully remove the egg from the vinegar. Wash and wipe gently. You will see that the eggshell has become soft, it is pliable even with a light touch. It's like a naked egg!
Naked eggs are really cool. The inner membrane remains intact, so the eggs are quite fragile. They can be squeezed gently. The eggs are translucent, so you can see the yolk, which, interestingly, always floats up.
If you drop a bare egg from a very low height (about 2-3 cm), it is likely to bounce like a rubber ball. (Be careful, it gets dirty and can burst!).

The explosion of Supernova
According to the leading scientists, two stars will collide in the constellation cygnus. As a result, a supernova will occur, and a huge amount of energy will be ejected into space. It will be brighter that the light from a majority of stars in the galaxy. The consequences will be visible to the naked eye from the earth's surface. It will take place in 2022.

The largest black holes grow faster than their galaxies, according to new research.

Two studies from separate groups of researchers find that so-called supermassive black holes are bigger than astronomers would have calculated from their surroundings alone. Supermassive black holes are enormous gravity wells found in the center of large galaxies.

No stress, though: The black holes are generally no longer growing, and they aren't capable of eating their host galaxies for dinner",Science

Society has always been in a bare knuckle fight with Mother Nature. Going toe to toe with some of her more interesting jabs and punches. Testing ourselves, and oftentimes losing, to hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, Tsunamis and meteor strikes. We‚Äôve become accustomed to these attacks‚Ä¶ But‚Ä¶ every so often, nature has a trick up her sleeve; an Ace that comes out of nowhere and really floors us. 

One two strikes that although natural have no rational cause. Today we are going to list 10 strange unexplained phenomena that stomp science.

645,FnMCIrKRkQM,Naked Science - Pyramids,"Subscribe to Naked Science - http://goo.gl/wpc2Q1

Every Wednesday we present a new video, so join us to see the truth laid bare...

For over four and a half thousand years the pyramids of Egypt have stood as wonders of the world.  The facts are astonishing, the Great Pyramid alone weighs almost six million tons and contains over 2.3 million stone blocks.  Naked Science sets out to uncover four great mysteries that still surround the pyramids, how were they built, who built them, why were they built, and what secrets may still lie hidden within their stones.  As four millennia and countless generations stand between us and the men who built the pyramids we have to study the buildings themselves to uncover the answers. 

With British engineer Denys Stocks we learn the art of pyramid building.  Stocks has spent twenty years mastering the techniques used by the ancient workmen and shows how such vast quantities of stone were quarried, transported and fitted by a civilisation that had not even invented the wheel.  To show the scale of the achievement we asked construction manager and pyramid scholar Craig Smith to calculate what it would take to build a pyramid in today‚Äôs money.

We may know the names of the pharaohs who commissioned the pyramids but who actually hauled the blocks.  Legends have always held that slaves built the pyramids but we venture into the science of Forensic Egyptology to discover the truth.  Mark Lehner discovered the town of the pyramid builders while Zahi Hawass takes us on a tour of their tombs.

There may be few records of how the pyramids were built but hieroglyphic texts within some pyramids hint at their reveal purpose.  Salima Ikram and Jim Allen help us find for the reason why the pyramids were built within these spells and incantations.  However Robert Bauval, believes there may be deep connections between the pyramids and astronomy.  He believes links to the stars are hidden within their stones and chambers.

Finally we follow work in pyramid exploration as teams hunt for hidden chambers and use robots to explore the mysterious shafts at the centre of the Great Pyramid of Giza.",Science
646,xctlaTmJ_zQ,22 CRAZY HOME SCIENCE TRICKS YOU'VE NEVER SEEN,"SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS FOR KIDS AND ADULTS

 Check out a collection of cool experiments that kids and grown-ups will totally love:
-    Bouncy egg experiment. Supplies you will need a glass of vinegar, marker core piece, and a raw egg. Remove a core piece from a marker and place into a glass of vinegar. Carefully place an egg into a glass. Leave the egg in the glass for 1 day. When the egg has started to become translucent, take it out of the glass. Your bouncy egg is ready. Check if it‚Äôs jumping
-    Check out if an egg is fresh. Place eggs in water. Old eggs will be on the top of the water.
-    Growing and shrinking eggs. Pour vinegar in a high glass and put an egg inside and leave for one day. The egg has become bigger and translucent. Take this egg and place in a glass full of maple syrup and wait for 1 day. The egg will shrink. After that place the same egg in a glass with water, also you can add some dye. And again, wait for a day. Check out the result!
-    Ink experiment. Make a drop of water and a drop of glue. Add one drop of ink to water and glue and watch the magic!

654,4ZCQom3LmZQ,Finding Life Beyond Earth - Where Are We in the Universe? Space Science Documentary,"Since the beginning of civilization, humanity has wondered whether we are alone in the universe. As NASA has explored our solar system and beyond, it has developed increasingly sophisticated tools to address this fundamental question. Within our solar system, NASA‚Äôs missions have searched for signs of both ancient and current life, especially on Mars and soon, Jupiter‚Äôs moon Europa. Beyond our solar system, missions, such as Kepler and TESS, are revealing thousands of planets orbiting other stars. The explosion of knowledge of planets orbiting other stars, called exoplanets, and the results of decades of research on signatures of life - what scientists call biosignatures - have encouraged NASA to address, in a scientifically rigorous way, whether humanity is alone. Beyond searching for evidence of just microbial life, NASA now is exploring ways to search for life advanced enough to create technology.",Science

IT WAS a speech that changed the way we think of space and time. The year was 1908, and the German mathematician Hermann Minkowski had been trying to make sense of Albert Einstein‚Äôs hot new idea ‚Äì what we now know as special relativity ‚Äì describing how things shrink as they move faster and time becomes distorted. ‚ÄúHenceforth space by itself and time by itself are doomed to fade into the mere shadows,‚Äù Minkowski proclaimed, ‚Äúand only a union of the two will preserve an independent reality.‚Äù

And so space-time ‚Äì the malleable fabric whose geometry can be changed by the gravity of stars, planets and matter ‚Äì was born. It is a concept that has served us well, but if physicist Petr Horava is right, it may be no more than a mirage. Horava, who is at the University of California, Berkeley, wants to rip this fabric apart and set time and space free from one another in order to come up with a unified theory that reconciles the disparate worlds of quantum mechanics and gravity ‚Äì one the most pressing challenges to modern physics.

Since Horava published his work in January 2009, it has received an astonishing amount of attention. Already, more than 250 papers have been written about it. Some researchers have started using it to explain away the twin cosmological mysteries of dark matter and dark energy. Others are finding that black holes might not behave as we thought. If Horava‚Äôs idea is right, it ‚Ä¶",Science
657,4i48EeMM1l0,25 SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS TO BLOW YOUR MIND,"Do you know that if you put an egg in vinegar for two days, the shell will dissolve and the egg will become elastic? Under the influence of vinegar, calcium, which makes up the shell, dissolves and disappears in the form of gas bubbles.  

Only the film between the shell and the egg remains intact. It turns out funny egg that looks like jelly. The egg increases slightly in size as it is saturated with vinegar. You can play with the egg as a ball. The film is very thin and, therefore, may be torn if handled carelessly. If you experiment with a boiled egg, it will become as elastic as a rubber ball. If you add a highlighter dye to vinegar, you will get a luminous elastic egg. 

I will show you how to make a similarity of crystals from sugar syrup and ice cubes. I'll show you a simple and very beautiful trick with soaring tea bags, we can call it ""Rocket Soaring"". When burning air heats up and rises up, forming a stream of hot air. When a bag burns and its weight becomes such that this flow can lift it, the light remnants of an almost burnt bag rise too.

Also look at the trick with a tennis ball and hairdryer, the trick with a candle, the trick with a balancing tin can, and others.

7. NEKO
Thanks to her exceptionally well-hidden grave on the Greek island of Sikinos, a noblewoman named Neko and her precious gold jewelry remained undiscovered for 1,800 years. Greek archaeologists discovered Neko‚Äôs grave in 2018. Grave robbers didn‚Äôt miss out on her treasures for a lack of trying - in fact, they hit various other tombs on Sikinos, which is part of the Cyclades archipelago. 

6. MAGNETIC STATUES
In a park within a small town called La Democracia, which is located near the Pacific Guatemalan coast, there‚Äôs a series of 11 ancient stone ‚Äúpotbelly‚Äù sculptures on display. Surprisingly, these sculptures are magnetized on certain parts, indicating that the pre-Columbian civilization that crafted them may have had a knowledge of magnetism.

5. SANDBY BORG
Around 1,600 years ago, a gruesome fight occurred at a fort called Sandby Borg on Sweden‚Äôs √ñland Island. Hundreds of people were killed in the attack and left unburied. After the attack, the site was left alone by neighbors, leading researchers to believe that it was considered a taboo place.

4. Panga ya Saidi
The 1,076-square-foot main chamber of the Panga Ya Saidi cave network in Kenya‚Äôs Rift Valley bears evidence of 78,000 continuous years of human occupation. Let that sink in for a minute! It sits where grassland meets with coastal tropical forest, thus providing its former inhabitants with the convenient ability to exploit resources from both environments. 

3. THOUSANDS OF TEETH
On two separate occasions in 2018, batches of over 1,000 teeth were discovered in different parts of the world. Last year, archaeologists conducting a preliminary excavation at the site of a future subway station began uncovering teeth. They ultimately collected over 1,000 teeth, which were estimated to be around a century old.

2. ATA
In 2003, someone discovered a naturally-mummified, six-inch-tall skeleton near a ghost town in the Chilean Atacama Desert. The skeleton was female and had unusually hard bones for her size, as well as a conical-shaped head. Rumors quickly spread that the skeleton was that of an alien. In 2012, a doctor named Steven Greer analyzed the skeleton, who was named Ata, using x-ray and CT imaging. 

1. A RARE PAINTING OF JESUS
Earlier this year, archaeologists from the University of Haifa announced the discovery of a rare early painting of Jesus inside an ancient church in the Israeli village of Shivta. The 1,500-year-old depiction of Jesus looks quite different from the popular Western image of him. It was found in the Negev Desert of southern Israel among the ruins of a Byzantine-era farming village.

10. The Piri Reis Map
In 1929, a German theologian was cataloging items in the Topkapi Palace Library in Istanbul, and he came across a gazelle skin parchment with an unusual map drawn onto it. Dated back to 1513, it was drawn and signed by Turkish cartographer Hagji Ahmed Muhiddin Piri, an admiral in the Turkish Navy at the time and the map is now known as the Piri Reis map. 

9. The Jehoash Inscription
In 2001, a group of Israeli archaeologists were shown a stone tablet, supposedly dating back to 1000 BC, with writing that describes repairs that were made to the temple of Solomon‚Ä¶ the first evidence ever to have been found about the renowned building. It underwent a series of tests, including radiocarbon dating, before being declared as a genuine artifact. 

8. Spanish Hill, Pennsylvania
Spanish Hill, in Pennsylvania, was first described by an explorer in 1795 who said it was ‚Äòthe shape of a sugar loaf, about 100 feet high, with a level top, on which are the remains of intrenchments'. Others saw the remains of walls, and further archaeological investigations have found potential evidence of a Native American society, including shell heaps, corn, flint chips, and various other implements.

7. How Alexander the Great Died
By 323 BC, Alexander the Great had secured an empire that stretched from the Balkans to modern day Pakistan, but his at the age of 32 that year has been a mystery ever since. He was on the verge of attacking another empire, when he became ill and, after 12 excruciating days, finally passed away.

6. Otzi
In 1991, the body of a 5,000-year-old mummy, now known as Otzi, was discovered by mountain climbers. The remains of the 45-year-old were remarkably well preserved, which has allowed researchers to examine in detail the causes of this. Despite this, there's a lot that remains unknown, and there's still great debate about how he met his end.

5. Tikal Temple 33
Tikal Temple 33 was a 108-foot-high Maya funerary pyramid that was found in the remains of the Maya city of Tikal, along with a number of other monuments. It was built in three different stages of construction in the year 457 when King Siyaj Chan K'awiil II's shrine was remodeled, and it's one of the most investigated structures of the city.

4. The Cyrus Cylinder
The Cyrus Cylinder is a clay cylinder which is inscribed in Akkadian cuneiform script. It was created in 539 BC on order of Cyrus the Great, the founder of the first Persian empire when he took control of Babylon.

3. The Sandia Cave
The Sandia Cave in Las Huertas Canyon, New Mexico, was once believed to be a place with vast evidence of the earliest inhabitants to live on the continent, but a set of events has led the archaeological community to question everything that they once thought to be true.

2. The Runamo Inscription
With ancient cultures having used symbols that we wouldn't necessarily recognize today, how would you know for sure whether something was actually written, or just occurred naturally? That's the question that's divided archaeologists in the case of the Runamo inscription, which is located near a church in Blekinge in southern Sweden.

1. The Talpiot Tomb
In 1980, a tomb was unearthed at a burial site in the Talpiot neighborhood of East Jerusalem, and inside there were 10 ossuaries‚Ä¶ some of which bore inscriptions that have been translated as saying ‚ÄòJesus son of Joseph‚Äô, ‚ÄòMary‚Äô, and a few other names associated with the New Testament. These names led some researchers to believe that this was the burial place of the family of Jesus of Nazareth, while many others rejected the idea, saying that these names were very common at the time.

The 20th century scientist Albert Einstein developed a theory called Special Relativity. The ideas of Special Relativity are very hard to imagine because they aren't about what we experience in everyday life, but scientists have confirmed them.

Special Relativity also says that a surprising thing happens when you move through space-time,

10. The Ulfberht Swords
Ulfberht swords were the weapon of choice of the Vikings, along with other tribes around northern Europe. They had a long, double edged blade, and a straight crossbar over the grip. There are only about 170 still known to exist today, each of which dates to between the 9th and 11th centuries! And the cool thing is they have the tell-tale inscription in the blade itself.

9. The Drepanosaurus
Whenever a new fossil is found, it gives further clues as to the evolution of animals, and of those that once roamed the earth. Every now and then, though, something is found that makes no sense at all in terms of scientific understanding, and requires a complete re-think of what is taken as fact. This is exactly what‚Äôs happening with a little known creature, the Drepanosaurus.

8. Rat Kings
The Rat Kings are a rare phenomena from the animal kingdom that is so bizarre, no-one is entirely sure how it happens. You may have seen one before, but if you haven‚Äôt- they really are something quite unusual. They have been a part of legend for centuries, and are formed when a number of rats become attached by the tail.

7. The Martian Meteorite
In 1984, a meteorite fell to earth, something that in itself is no unusual thing. But this one, known as ALH84001, was found to hold secrets that no-one has been able to explain. The 4.1 billion-year-old rock is thought to have originated on Mars, having been dislodged during a collision, and floated through space until it fell into earth‚Äôs atmosphere. Unlike other similar specimens, the surface of this rock had something very unusual- what appeared to be the signs of fossilised bacteria. 

6. The Longyou Grottoes
The Longyou Grottoes are a series of underground structures near the village of Shiyan Beicun, in the Zhejiang province in China. They are thought to be at least 2000 years old, but scientists and researchers have no idea how they were built, what they were used for, or even who was responsible for them.

5. What was the first dinosaur?
Since we first realized that dinosaurs roamed the earth, palaeontologists have been trying to understand the full range of creatures that once lived, with particular interest revolving around which was the first dinosaur to ever live.

4. The Nampa Stone Doll
The Nampa figurine looks like any other that has been made by an ancient civilisation. The mystery surrounding this one, though, is how it came to be in the place where it was found. It was discovered in 1889 near the town of Nampa in Idaho. Workers were searching for water, and dug a well, which involved drilling a borehole to 295 feet. 

3. The Piri Reis Map
Today we take maps for granted. Satellite technology combined with the work of cartographers over the years, plus Google of course, have created incredibly detailed depictions of our planet. All we have to do is use our smartphone! This wasn‚Äôt always the way, clearly, and maps from centuries ago were just kind of close approximations based on ship voyages.

2. The Voynich Manuscript
The 600 year old Voynich manuscript is often thought of as being the most mysterious book that has ever been written, and still, to this day, scientists aren‚Äôt able to explain what‚Äôs inside. 

1. Dinosaur and Human Footprints
The final mystery is one which calls into question the idea that humans weren‚Äôt around at the time of the dinosaurs, because their footprints have been found side by side. The discovery was made in the Paluxy river, Texas, where hundreds of dinosaur footprints have been found. Their foot impressions were perfectly preserved by the river bed.

Have you ever heard about something that is unexplained? There are a lot of bizarre things in the world such as animals raining from the sky, or weird unexplained heat anomalies found inside the Great Pyramid of Giza. Sometimes the answer is found, and sometimes these things remain a mystery that science cannot explain. Check out these 10 Natural Phenomena that Science Can‚Äôt Explain. 

10. Mammatus clouds ‚Äì which means ""mammary cloud"", is a cellular pattern of pouches hanging underneath the base of a cloud, these are typically heavy cumulonimbus rainclouds. Mammatus are most often associated with severe weather, and they can appear before or after a storm. 

9. 'Heat anomaly' found in Great Pyramid of Giza ‚Äì Scientists have been studying the Great Pyramid of Giza, which is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and have found strange heat signatures that have no explanation.

8. Oakville Blobs - On August 7, 1994 during a rainstorm, blobs of translucent gelatinous substance fell in the town of Oakville, Washington. Several attempts were made to identify the blobs. 

7. Lake Hillier, Australia - Australia is the home of unusual ‚Äòpink lakes‚Äô. Lake Hillier is one of them. Located on Middle Island, this body of water is famous for it‚Äôs remarkable bubble gum pink color. 600 meters long and surrounded by a rim of sand and thick woods of eucalyptus trees, this pink lake still surprises and intrigues scientists.

6. Socotra Island, Yemen - Want to feel like you‚Äôre visiting another planet? Check out Socotra Island off the coast of Yemen. It has been called the most alien-looking place on Earth, and a ‚Äòlost world‚Äô because the heat and drought conditions of the island have produced around 800 rare species of flora and fauna, and a third of those can‚Äôt be seen anywhere else on the planet. 

5. Kelimutu, Indonesia - Mount Kelimutu is a volcano in Flores, Indonesia. The mountain has three volcanic crater lakes that vary colors from each other at different times, making them surreal and exciting to be discovered. 

4. Brain Injury Turns Man Into Math Genius - After being brutally attacked in 2002, Jason Padgett now sees the world through a geometric lens. His devastating injury seems to have unlocked part of his brain that makes everything in his world appear to have a mathematical structure. 

3. Stonehenge - For centuries, historians and archaeologists have puzzled over Stonehenge, which took Neolithic builders around 1,500 years to build. Located in Southern England, it is comprised of roughly 100 massive upright stones placed in a circular layout. 

2. Animal rain phenomenon - The origins of this bizarre animal rain phenomenon have evolved throughout history. The first reported phenomenon occurred in the first century AD, when Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder documented fish and frogs raining from the sky. 

1. Tsingy de Bemaraha, Madagascar - The Tsingy de Bemaraha is a national park located in the Melaky Region, northwest Madagascar. The site is unique with its biodiversity and exceptional landscape called the Tsingy - which can be translated into "" where one cannot walk barefoot"".",Science

Why do we sleep? We spend a third of our lives in slumber, but science has yet to determine exactly why we have do it. Here‚Äôs a look at how sleep works, why we‚Äôre not getting enough sleep, what happens if you DON‚ÄôT sleep, and an idea about where sleep came from in the first place.

710,qw_O9Qiwq,"""Science and the taboo of psi"" with Dean Radin","Google Tech Talks
January, 16 2008

ABSTRACT

Do telepathy, clairvoyance and other ""psi"" abilities exist? The majority of the general population believes that they do, and yet fewer than one percent of mainstream academic institutions have any faculty known for their interest in these frequently reported experiences. Why is a topic of enduring and widespread interest met with such resounding silence in academia? The answer is not due to a lack of scientific evidence, or even to a lack of scientific interest, but rather involves a taboo. I will discuss the nature of this taboo, some of the empirical evidence and critical responses, and speculate on the implications.

Speaker: Dean Radin
Dean Radin is a researcher and author in the field of parapsychology. He is Senior Scientist at the Institute of Noetic Sciences and four-time former President of the Parapsychological Association. He holds an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and a masters degree in electrical engineering and a doctorate in educational psychology from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He has worked at AT&T Bell Labs and GTE Labs, mainly on human factors of advanced telecommunications products and services, and held appointments at Princeton University, Edinburgh University, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, SRI International, Interval Research Corporation, and Boundary Institute. At these facilities he was engaged in basic research on exceptional human capacities, principally psi phenomena.",Science

716,fkd3BVM7b94,Naked Science - Alien Contact,"Subscribe to Naked Science - http://goo.gl/wpc2Q1

Every other Wednesday we present a new video, so join us to see the truth laid bare...

Just for a moment, imagine a universe awash with life, where we humans are not the only intelligent beings around.  What might these alien races look like?  Could we communicate with them, or even recognise them as intelligent?  And what would they make of our violent and dangerous species?  Might they take one look, and decide not to bother with such primitive beings?  A planetary nursery filled with spiteful, galactic infants.  On the other hand, in our imaginary scenario, they may enrich us with scientific knowledge beyond our imagination.  Or could an encounter with aliens have a more destructive outcome?  It could be a bad day for human kind.  But relax, it‚Äôs just make believe, it could never happen, could it?

A mysterious crash in Roswell, New Mexico during the 1940s convinced many that our planet is being visited by space aliens.  Crop circles in Britain have only added fuel to the fire.  Few scientists doubt that life indeed exists elsewhere, but some believe we're more likely to make contact via radio waves.  Join the search for extra-terrestrials and hear from scientists who think we are on the verge of making contact.",Science
717,DuFyGHgGIKg,Physicist Breaks Down The Science Of 10 Iconic Marvel Scenes,"To celebrate the release of ‚ÄúAvengers: Endgame,‚Äù we had physicist (and lifelong comic book fan) Jim Kakalios take a closer look at the physics of the Marvel universe. Here he reacts to 10 memorable scenes from Marvel movies and rates them based on their accuracy. Find out what exactly quantum mechanics, time dilation, Einstein‚Äôs theory of special relativity, and spider silk tell us about the superheroes of the Marvel franchise.

Which weapon would you rather have in a fight: Thor‚Äôs Mjolnir hammer or Captain America‚Äôs shield? Hint: The answer has to do with the conservation of energy ‚Äî and the sonoluminescence of vibranium. Dr. Kakalios breaks down the physics behind this and many other Marvel phenomena, including Shuri‚Äôs holographic car in ‚ÄúBlack Panther;‚Äù  Peter Parker‚Äôs spider-webbing train save in ‚ÄúSpider-Man 2;‚Äù the multiverse theory of ‚ÄúDoctor Strange;‚Äù the role of Pym particles and the Higgs boson in ‚ÄúAnt-Man;‚Äù artificial gravity in ‚ÄúGuardians of the Galaxy;‚Äù and Tony Stark‚Äôs cybernetic helmet and gold-titanium exoskeleton in ‚ÄúIron Man.‚Äù He sheds light on why Carol Danvers doesn‚Äôt age from ‚ÄúCaptain Marvel‚Äù to ‚ÄúAvengers: Endgame;‚Äù why the Space Stone is so powerful when yielded by Thanos in ‚ÄúAvengers: Infinity War;‚Äù and what‚Äôs with all the talk of quantum entanglement, quantum tunneling, and ‚Äúquantum mumbo-jumbo‚Äù in ‚ÄúAnt-Man and the Wasp.‚Äù

Kakalios is the author of three books ‚Äî ‚ÄúThe Physics of Superheroes,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Physics of Everyday Things,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Amazing Story of Quantum Mechanics.‚Äù He was a science consultant for Sony‚Äôs 2012 film ‚ÄúThe Amazing Spider-Man.‚Äù Before that, he won an Emmy for his work as a science consultant for the Warner Bros. superhero film ‚ÄúWatchmen.‚Äù A physics professor at the University of Minnesota, Kakalios teaches a popular class that uses comic books to illustrate the principles of physics.

719,TcxZSmzPw8k,The Science of Six Degrees of Separation,"Are all people on Earth really connected through just six steps?
There's much more science in this than I initially expected. It turns out ordered networks with a small degree of randomness become small-work networks. This is why your acquaintances turn out to be more important in job searches and finding new opportunities than close friends.

DON'T SEND ME AN EMAIL anymore...
1. Do not send it directly to me unless you know me.
2. Send the email to someone you have met IN PERSON and know on a first name basis AND THEY KNOW YOU.
3. Make the subject line 'Six Degrees of Veritasium'
4. Explain that you're trying to get this email to me and ask them to forward it on to me (only if they know me IRL) or someone they know who might know me.
5. If your email reaches me by Sept. 1, 2015 I will email you back and ask for your address so I can send you a postcard.

Every other Wednesday we present a new video, so join us to see the truth laid bare...

Yellowstone, Wyoming.  In spring 2003, strange things began happening in America's most famous national park.  The tallest geyser in the world, which can go 50 years without erupting, burst into life.  Spraying columns of superheated water, 100s of feet into the air.  There were new cracks in the ground, the ground heated up to the point where the National Park Service had to close some trails.  Not long after, a group of bison collapsed and died, victims of poisonous fumes from below the ground.  Satellite pictures revealed that something ominous was happening beneath the earth.  On the internet, unfounded rumours spread that a super volcano, an eruption so large, that it only occurs on average every 700,000 years, was about to blow.  These things happen, you can look at the earth and see the scars.  They happen, and they're going to happen again.

A million times more powerful than Hiroshima, super volcanoes are real events.  Over 20 have been recorded in the history of the earth and over half of these happened in the USA.  For the last 30 years scientists have been investigating where the next super volcano could erupt.  Their research has revealed that an active super volcano exists under Yellowstone National Park.  Naked Science follows these scientists and investigates the vital question, if the Yellowstone Caldera erupted today, could we survive?  This documentary includes a Yellowstone timeline of past eruptions, how Yellowstone would affect the world, and what impact will it be for the United States.",Science

There are many surprising experiments with balloons and water. Try them all and don't forget to tell us in the comments, which experiments you liked most of all! For example, a balloon can help you to separate pepper from salt using static electricity.
Another cool salt idea is watching how it melts an ice cube or helps to make a cola fountain.

All of these tricks take advantage of static electricity. In general, the lower the humidity, the better these tricks will work. The most impressive one to me is the floating bag trick. Depending on the conditions, you can float an entire grocery sack. 

1. Hover Plate: (You need Styrofoam Plates and a cloth) Styrofoam plates are great for static electricity tricks. When you give them a charge and hold one above the other, you can feel an incredible amount of resistance.

2. Can Can Go (You need a coke can, PVC pipe and a cloth) This is a classic but still fun. Try standing the can up and then tip it over with static, or try pulling 2 cans at the same time.

3. Stick Around (You need a small wooden stick, glass jar, thread, tape, PVC pipe and a cloth) This one is fun because half of the time the wooden stick will come toward the pvc pipe, and other times it will move away from the pipe. When it moves away, it will stick the the side of the jar and remain there for a period of time. It also fun to use as large a jar as possible to increase the dramatic effect of the pipe moving the stick from such a large distance.

4. Bubble Trouble (You need bubble solution, plexi-glass, PVC pipe, straw and a cloth. This is a fun trick because the bubbles change their shape and move when the pvc pipe is near. It's also fun to create bubbles inside of bubbles to watch the effect of the static electricity. And also create multiple bubbles on the sheet and watch them all travel toward the pipe.

5. Dancing Balls (You need styrofoam balls, aluminum foil, plexi-glass, cloth, and an area to keep the balls from escaping. This trick is really impressive but can be a bit difficult to recreate. When the plexi-glass plate is charged and placed over the balls, they all jump up and stick to the bottom of the glass. For a few moments they travel around sporadically until they finally settle. But when you put your finger near the glass, they all start jumping around. It's also fun to use these balls with styrofoam plates / cups. If you place the ball on a charged plate, it will shoot off of the plate, or stick to it, even if the plate is held sideways or upside down.

6. Water Bender (You need a cup that you can poke a hole in,  water, PVC pipe and a cloth. This is  a classic but still fun. 

7. Balloon Fight (You need balloons, thread, PVC pipe and cloth. When the conditions are just right, the balloon can almost levitate about the pipe. But most of the time you can have fun pushing the balloons around with the charged pipe.

8. Electroscope (You need, steel wire, jar, straw, aluminum foil, PVC pipe and a cloth) This one is really impressive to see in person. A really cool effect to try, which you can see in this video, is to rub the cloth on the pvc pipe from several feet away from the jar. When you run the pipe, you can see the aluminum foil pieces in the jar, moving. I was able to stand as far as 5 feet away and still see the effect.

9. Wingardium Leviosa (You need very light weight / thin plastic bags, cloth, PVC pipe) This is my favorite trick. Again, with the correct conditions, you can get the plastic pieces  to float over foot above the pipe. Produce bags from the grocery store work great. You can float an entire produce bag in the right conditions.

Have fun!",Science

745,5pdf11GTX-,2019 Scheidel Lecture: Communication and the Future of Science,"For the 2019 Scheidel lecture, the Department of Communication welcomed Dr. Dietram A. Scheufele, a John E. Ross Professor in Science Communication and Vilas Distinguished Achievement Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Morgridge Institute for Research. He is a leading expert on science communication, political communication, and science and technology policy.

Dr. Dietram A. Scheufele discussed how modern science across disciplines is increasingly faced with often controversial public deliberations surrounding its societal applications. Issues like genetically modified organisms, artificial intelligence, and human genome editing have sparked much debate recently. His lecture tackled burning current questions including how we form policy stances about emerging technologies, why we are sometimes so divided in our interpretations of scientific facts, the role of media especially in online environments, and the part communication can play in promoting better policy discourse around emerging science.",Science

752,NVuQh1-JQ,Scientists Created a Plastic That‚Äôs Infinitely Recyclable,"Plastic is suffocating the planet, but what if we could make recycling plastic more efficient? This Lawrence Berkeley National Lab team has created a brand new kind of plastic that can be recycled endlessly. 

Are You Seasoning Your Food With Microplastics?  - 

Read More: 
Closed-loop recycling of plastics enabled by dynamic covalent diketoenamine bonds
 
""The closed-loop polymer life cycles enabled by PDKs contrast with those for conventional polymers, which are synthesized using irreversible bond-forming reactions that make it difficult and costly to recover the original monomers in high purity. Furthermore, while dynamic covalent polymers have been designed, in principle, around the ability to exchange bonds27, examples of energy-efficient depolymerization and chemical separations to obtain immediately reusable monomers are exceedingly rare. ""

Plastic Gets a Do-Over: Breakthrough Discovery Recycles Plastic From the Inside Out
 
According to the researchers, the problem with many plastics is that the chemicals added to make them useful ‚Äì such as fillers that make a plastic tough, or plasticizers that make a plastic flexible ‚Äì are tightly bound to the monomers and stay in the plastic even after it‚Äôs been processed at a recycling plant.

Facts and Figures about Materials, Waste and Recycling
 
""PA used data from the American Chemistry Council and the National Association for PET Container Resources to measure the recycling of plastic. While overall the amount of recycled plastics is relatively small‚Äî3.1 million tons for a 9.1 percent recycling rate in 2015‚Äîthe recycling of some specific types of plastic containers is more significant. The recycling rate of PET bottles and jars was 29.9 percent in 2015, and the rate for HDPE natural bottles was 30.3 percent in 2015.""

The main ingredient is hydrogen; it makes up most of the water in your cup.  And that formed in the big bang.  How it got from there, into your cappuccino is one of the most dramatic stories in science.  It has taken thousands of scientists to track its trail.  We follow it through stars and galaxies, exploding supernovae, and giant clouds of gas to show just how it reached your cup.

762,0tqgWuSIZUg,Naked Science - Moon Mysteries,"Subscribe to Naked Science - http://goo.gl/wpc2Q1

Every other Wednesday we present a new video, so join us to see the truth laid bare...

The moon is far more than just a beautiful object in the night sky.

Ever since its creation 4.5 billion years ago the moon has been edging away from Earth into space.  Throughout its journey, it has influenced our planet in different ways.  But one things clear, without it life would never have emerged on Earth.

4.5 billion years ago the moon forms when another planet slams into the early Earth.  The impact knocks our planet ‚Äúoff-balance‚Äù onto an axis of 23 degrees, which we still rotate around today.  This is what gives us our seasons.  Without it we would have no summers, springs, winters or falls.

4 billion years ago the solar system endures the most violent meteorite bombardment in its history, the Lunar Cataclysm.  The Earth, being 50 times bigger than the moon, exerts a massive gravitational pull on incoming space debris.  Because the moon is still so close to Earth it too gets hit.  99% of all craters on the lunar surface visible today are a result of this bombardment.

3 billion years ago the Earth has water and oceans.  Because the moon is far closer its gravitational pull is far stronger on the Earth.  The tides it creates are thousands of feet high and smash hundreds of miles inland every day.  Scientists believe that these tides feed the Primordial Soup with the minerals required to start life.  Without them only the most basic microbes would be on Earth today.

Today the moon has the same gravitational pull as a mosquito landing on your head, yet some people still believe it can influence our planet in bizarre ways.

The San Francisco Police Department tell us how crime appears to soar during a full moon.  But the scientific data suggests otherwise, studies show no correlation between the Full Moon and violence.  Naked Science investigates.

Scientific research into the moon is allowing some scientists to predict when natural disasters will strike.  Some researchers believe that when the sun and moon align and pull together on the Earth they can trigger both earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.

In the future the moon will move so far from Earth that it will affect the fine balance of our planet, sending our climate tumbling out of control.",Science
763,APZCfmgzoS0,Fasting vs. Eating Less: What's the Difference? (Science of Fasting),"This is about the drastic physiological differences between fasting and eating less

*NOTE* One of the key things in being able to fast in a healthy matter is entering the state of ketosis - that is, switching your metabolism from burning carbohydrate to burning fat. *Considering most people have been burning carbohydrate their whole lives* this can make fasting a challenge. Upton Sinclair recommends doing quite long fasts - 12 days, but you may want to work your way up to longer fasts. Unless you are relatively keto adapted (or have experience with fasting of course), it's important that you take precautions while doing a fast. Fasting isn't inherently dangerous, *but diving into fasting when your body is in no way geared for it can be.*  I recommend doing more research before doing longer fasts. ""The Complete Guide to Fasting"" () is a good book to start with. 
As Tim Ferriss puts it: Please don't do anything stupid and kill yourself. It would make us both quite unhappy.

Just in case I should also say that  of course you need to balance fasting with eating - You need to survive off of something. I have been doing intermittent fasting the past year (22 hours fasted, 2 hours eating - you can widen it to 16/8, which still provides great benefits) and will fast for a couple days every other month or so. Several other people have recommend a routine like this - Tim Ferriss recommends doing a 3 day fast once per month and a 7 day fast once per year. 
Also make sure you're getting enough fat, protein, micronutrients and fiber to maintain a healthy weight and healthy body - *excessive* fasting can be very dangerous.

It gives you the key points in text or audio form from tons of different non-fiction books. Since I'm always going through so many books to get these done, it's very useful to get me exposed to more concepts beforehand to know if it's worth my time to buy and read through that particular book.

767,J4Ngqj5wO0,Naked Science - Loch Ness,"Subscribe to Naked Science - http://goo.gl/wpc2Q1

Every other Wednesday we present a new video, so join us to see the truth laid bare...

Naked Science investigates the truth behind the legend.

The legend of the Loch Ness monster dates back 1500 years.  Since then, 1000 eye witnesses, countless photographs, sonar records and films have testified to the existence of a Loch Ness monster.  Yet despite extensive exploration, observation and scientific analysis, still no real evidence has been discovered.

This documentary starts off charting the early history of the legend.  From the first sighting by St Columba in 565AD, to the ‚ÄòSpicer‚Äô sighting that kicked off the modern legend in 1933 and the world famous ‚ÄòSurgeon‚Äôs Photo‚Äô from 1934 that captured what appeared to be a head and neck emerging from Loch Ness.  From the ‚ÄòSurgeon‚Äôs Photo‚Äô, the press, frenzied public and scientific observers soon concluded that the creature living in the loch was a long-extinct dinosaur called a plesiosaur.  A preposterous suggestion it would seem.  However Naked Science profiles the coelacanth.  A fish thought to be extinct 80 million years ago but discovered in 1938, to much surprise, living off the coast of Madagascar.

But even if it was a dinosaur from the Triassic period, how on earth did it get into the loch?   Loch Ness was gouged into today‚Äôs U shape valley by a series of glaciers that last melted 11,000 years ago, long after the extinction of the dinosaurs.  Naked Science profiles the geology of the loch and examines whether the sea has ever intruded into the loch perhaps carrying an unknown creature in with it.

After decades of intense observation of the surface of the loch by volunteer monster-hunters from around the world, in the late 60s Adrian Shine, skeptic, naturalist and leader of the Loch Ness Project arrived on the scene.  He took a different tactic.  Rather than search for a big monster, he looked for creatures just 100th of an inch in diameter, zooplankton.  A monster brood hiding out in the loch would need plenty of zooplankton, to support plenty of fish, who in turn could support large creatures.  Naked Science examines this ecology for clues.  We also discover there are internal waves called seiches, mirages, local wildlife, large fish such as sturgeon, floating logs, boat wakes and strong winds that could all have their place in provoking monster sightings.

But what of all the photographic evidence?  The most famous moving image of the Loch Ness monster is the so-called Dinsdale film of 1960.  At the time Britain‚Äôs foremost photographic analysis experts concluded it was an animate creature.  Using high spec imagery analysis we show how the famous Dinsdale film was most probably a helmsman in a boat.  Likewise we demonstrate that the McNab photo of 1955 could also be a boat wake.  Naked Science reveals that the notorious ‚ÄòSurgeon‚Äôs Photo‚Äô was actually a hoax.  We show how in 1933 big game-hunter Marmaduke Wetherell planted some footprints on the loch side and passed them off as the monster.  Humiliated when his first hoax was discovered, Wetherell‚Äôs revenge was the ‚ÄòSurgeon‚Äôs Photo‚Äô.  In a reconstruction, we show how easy it was for him to fabricate a monster from a toy submarine and reveal how the hoax remained a secret for 50 years.  Finally we look at the most unique theory by Italian geologist Dr Piccardi, that earth tremors along the Great Glen fault provoke water disturbance that are mistaken for monsters thrashing around in the water.",Science
768,Er9D00DXQQ,Science Has Found Proof of the Existence of God!,"How to be Saved from Hell:

That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Romans 10:9

For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. John 

For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 

For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: Romans 8 

For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 

For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. Ephesians 2

One last note, I've had some comments on me  mispronouncing height as heighth.  My possible responses:

1.  sometimes I get nervous in front of the camera and have moments where my brain shuts down. 

2. We grew up pronouncing it that way.

3. We all make mistakes.....but is it really a mistake ?

4..  Merriam Webster dictionary to my rescue- Heighth- expressed as a dialectal variant of the word height.   Part that rises or extends upwards,  the highest part",Science

SUMMARY
-Granodiorite rocks can easily be carved using temperature techniques. Hundreds of stone spheres were found quarried in the foothills of the Talamanca Mountains. Researchers even saw a gigantic ball weighing over 16 tons.
-The Roman dodecahedron had 12 flat pentagon-shaped faces with a knob protruding on each corner. It might have been a dice, a kid‚Äôs toy, a candle holder, a simple decoration, a measuring device on the battlefield, or an astronomical instrument, to name a few.
-The Phaistos Disk was made from clay and measures about 6.2 inches in diameter. Experts concluded that it was a prayer to an ancient Minoan goddess.
-The formula of Greek fire was a well-guarded state secret for over 7 centuries. Greek fire was used in naval warfare.
-Blades made from Damascus steel were the most sought after in medieval Europe. And that‚Äôs because they were the best swords at the time.
-The Iron pillar of Delhi dates back to the Gupta period, which lasted from about 240 to 590 C.E. A small amount of rust has started to form, but it is strange that there isn‚Äôt more.
-Viking Ulfberht swords are believed to have been made around 800 to 1,000 C.E., but experts were sure that the technology used to make swords of such extraordinary quality didn‚Äôt come around until 800 years later.
-The Voynich manuscript has 240 pages broken up into four sections: herbal, astrological, balneological, and pharmacological. There have literally been dozens of failed attempts to crack this thing.
-In 132 C.E., Zhang Heng, a Chinese inventor, astronomer, engineer, scientist, scholar, and artist, invented a seismoscope and presented it to the Han court as an instrument for measuring seasonal winds and the Earth‚Äôs movements.
-The Antikythera mechanism was retrieved by a group of divers in 1900 and has been dubbed ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs first analog computer‚Äù and it was made around 200 B.C.E.

People featured in this episode include Michael Egnor, MD, a Professor of Neurosurgery and Pediatrics at Stony Brook University; and Jeffrey Schwartz, MD, a Research Psychiatrist at UCLA and author many books such as The Mind and the Brain, Brain Lock, and You Are Not Your Brain.

Dr. Jeffrey M. Schwartz is a research psychiatrist at the School of Medicine at the University of California at Los Angeles and one of the world‚Äôs leading experts in neuroplasticity. Decades ago, he began to study the philosophy of conscious awareness, the idea that the actions of the mind have an effect on the workings of the brain. Jeff‚Äôs breakthrough work in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) provided the hard evidence that the mind can control the brain‚Äôs chemistry. He has lectured extensively to both professional and lay audiences in the US, Europe, and Asia. Jeff‚Äôs books include The Mind and the Brain: Neuroplasticity and the Power of Mental Force and the bestseller Brain Lock: Free Yourself from Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, the seminal book on OCD.

Science Uprising

Well-known scientists have been preaching a materialistic worldview rather than presenting the public with all the evidence. We are here to change that. The objective scientific evidence does not prove our universe is blind and purposeless.  It does not show we are simply meat machines. It does not prove that evolutionary mechanisms can completely account for the diversity of life on earth. This is what THEY want you to think. Think for yourself and make an informed decision.
Are you ready? The uprising has begun.

We went to the World Premiere of the film at the Toronto International Film Festival and talked to Director RIDLEY SCOTT, Author ANDY WEIR, Screenwriter DREW GODDARD, and stars MATT DAMON, JEFF DANIELS and MACKENZIE DAVIS.

We also visited NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and got their take on the film, including interviews Astronaut DREW FEUSTEL, Director of Planetary Science JIM GREEN, and Mars Researchers CARRIE BRIDGE, MATTHEW HEVERLY and KATIE STACK-MORGAN.",Science

But research in psychology, behavioral economics, and cognitive neuroscience shows that people are not very good at predicting what will make them happy, how happy it will make them, and how long that happiness will last. One reason for this is that our cultures provide us with both wisdom and myth about the true sources of human happiness. Our mothers were right about some things and wrong about others, and science is beginning to reveal which is which.",Science

785,UcZ44kQphl,Christianity - God and the Scientists,"Subscribe to Naked Science ‚Äì https://goo.gl/wpc2Q1

Ours is said to be a Godless age, yet billions remain faithful to religions thousands of years old.

Scientist Colin Blakemore examines Christianity's relationship with science, arguing that science is the biggest challenge Christianity has ever faced.

For more than 1,500 years Christians saw the bible as the primary source of knowledge, but in the 17th century a new movement emerged that challenged the Christian view of the world, the Scientific Revolution.  During the Renaissance the rising power of science forced the Catholic Church to silence rebellious scientists.  By the 19th century the enlightenment had given rise to a new generation of scientists who pushed Christianity into retreat.

If science continues to make discoveries that conflict with Christian Doctrine will the Scientific Revolution ultimately make Christianity redundant?

""Christianity: A History"" is a documentary series presenting alternative views on the history of the Christian faith, looking at its origins, development and turbulent past.  High profile British personalities examine a religion that has particular resonance for them.  In doing so, they bring their own perspectives to a challenging and comprehensive debate that explores Christianity's role in shaping the modern world.",Science
786,n7YQOzNuS,Science vs God: Bryan Enderle at TEDxUCDavis,"Bryan Enderle grew up in Modesto, CA though he now lives in Davis, CA with his wife, Peggy, and son, Isaac. Bryan received two BS degrees, in Chemical and Petroleum Engineering; an MA in Theology; and an MS and PhD in Chemical Engineering. Personally, he enjoys grappling with the topics of theology and science, both as individual and intersecting topics. Without arguing one way or the other, Enderle uses modern science to make certain fantastic aspects of a modern God more plausible. In doing so he creates a space where science and religion can coexist.

This is a class of astronomical objects that has undergone gravitational collapse, leaving behind a spheroidal region of space from which nothing can escape; not even light. 

Observational evidence indicates that all, or nearly all, massive galaxies contain a supermassive black hole, located at the galaxy's center. In the case of the Milky Way, the supermassive black hole corresponds to the location of Sagittarius A* at the Galactic Core.

791,Tzl0ELY_TiM,What is Computer Science?,"Part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-Vqx...

In this part 1 video of ""What is Computer Science?"" I cover programming and discrete math in some detail.

Computer science is often thought of as just glorified programming. But once you enter undergrad you will realize this is not the entire story. Computer science has more to it including discrete math, algorithms, theory of computation, hardware programming, and more. If you just want to learn how to program, then the computer science major will be more than you are expecting.

In this video I mostly cover discrete math and concepts within it because of how important it is for classes to come. Although it's not used in all your classes, I show you examples so you have an idea of what math you will encounter.

803,HQx5Be9g16U,10 Amazing Science Tricks Using Liquid!,"Add me on Facebook (click LIKE on Facebook to add me) - http://www.facebook.com/brusspup
Download the music in this video:
Song #1: Abyss - iTunes: 
Amazon download: 

Song #2: Over Rain
iTunes: 
Amazon: 

Detailed information for the tricks in the video:

1. Slow motion ball:

You need a thick liquid, preferably honey, a heavy ball, and a sphere shaped container. Place the heavy ball in the lower half of the sphere. Fill the lower half of the container with honey a little more than half.
If you use too little or too much, it will affect the motion of the ball.

2. Water fire starter. Credit goes to The King of Random for this idea. Be sure to check out his channel. He has a huge selection of amazing how to experiments. 

You need a plastic or glass container with a curved area. The Pom bottles work great. Fill the bottle with water. Fold 2 sheets of paper in half, twice. Print or scribble a black mark on one of the sheets. On a sunny day hold the bottle near the paper, focusing the light on the black area of the paper. Once it starts to smoke and a hole begins to form, wrap the other sheet of paper around the smoking piece. Wave the papers through the air to feed oxygen to the spark. Continue this until the paper catches on fire.

3.  No-leak magic bag:
     Al you need is a zip baggy, pencils and water. Fill the bag almost to the top. Zip it shut, and start sticking pencils through the bag. Sometimes a few drops will leak out, but overall, this is a simple yet impressive trick

4. Liquid Stacking:
You'll need a tall glass or bottle. Dish Soap, vegetable oil, dark corn syrup, rubbing alcohol, water and food coloring.

First add the dark corn syrup, then dish soap, then add food coloring to the water and pour it in with the bottle tilted, then add the vegetable oil (bottle tilted), and finally add food coloring to the alcohol and pour it in with the bottle tilted.

5. Invisible Bottle:

You need glycerin, a glass and a bottle that will fit in the glass. Fill both glass and bottle with glycerin and place the bottle in the glass. It looks like the bottle disappears.

6. Dancing Liquid:

You need  a powered speaker, a tone generator (can be found online), corn starch, water and plastic to protect the speaker. Pour 1/2 cup of corn starch in a bowl and 1/4 cup of water. Mix. Pour the liquid into the speaker and generate a 60hz tone.

7. Magic Water Barrier:

You need 2 of the same glasses. Hot water, cold water, food coloring and a thin piece of plastic or cardboard. Pour the hot water in 1 glass, the cold in the other glass, add food coloring, then place the plastic on top of the hot water glass. Turn the glass upside down, place it on top of the cold water glass, then carefully remove the plastic. Hot water is less dense than cold water, so it ""floats"" on top of the cold water.

8. Leidenfrost effect:

You need a pan, water and a stove. Turn the heat on high for about 4 minutes then add the water. This experiment can stain your pans.

9. Reverse Illusion:

Add all sorts of images or words behind a glass, then watch as it reverses when you add water in the glass.

10. Reversing Liquid:

You need 1 big glass, 1 smaller glass, 3 mixing glasses, corn syrup, pipettes, food coloring, and clips.

First pour the corn syrup into the 2 bigger glasses. Place the smaller glass inside of the bigger glass. Attach the clips to prevent the smaller glass from moving side to side in the bigger glass. Pour a small amount of corn syrup into the 3 mixing glasses. Add food coloring and stir. Fill each pipette with a different color, then add the colored corn syrup to your big glass. Turn the smaller glass carefully and watch the colors mix. Turn it back and watch them unmix.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Gary (Anthony Michael Hall) talks Wyatt (Ilan Mitchell-Smith) into using his computer to simulate a woman.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
John Hughes's third directorial effort, Weird Science, follows in the tradition of his previous teen-centered films, Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club. Anthony Michael Hall and Ilan Mitchell-Smith play the wannabe hipster Gary and his nebbish weak-willed best friend, Wyatt, a pair of high-school geeks who are hapless with members of the opposite sex. Using Wyatt's computer, they create what they believe is the ideal woman. A lightning storm brings that woman to life, and she takes the form of Kelly Le Brock. Lisa sets about building their self-confidence, but trouble begins brewing when Wyatt's cruel, military-minded older brother, Chet (Bill Paxton), begins to realize that something is not as it should be. Hughes would finish his cycle of high-school themed films with his next movie, Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

Adam Grimes has two decades of experience in the industry as a trader, analyst and system developer. 
Growing up in an agricultural community in America‚Äôs Midwest, Adams first trading experiences were in agricultural commodities and futures. 
He then moved to currency futures, trading during the Asian Financial Crisis, and to stock index futures and individual stocks. His trading experience covers all major asset classes‚Äìfutures, currencies, stocks, options, and other derivatives, and the full range of timeframes from very short term scalping to constructing portfolios for multi-year holding periods.

Adam holds an MBA from The Ohio State University, and is currently Chief Investment Officer of Talon Advisors, LLC, a boutique research and advisory firm for which he writes daily market commentary and trade notes. 

Prior to joining Talon Advisors, Adam held the positions of VP of Quantitative System Development at Level Partners, LLC, Senior Analyst and Trader at MBF Asset Management on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and Chief Technical Strategist at SMB Capital. 

Adam is the author of The Art & Science of Technical Analysis: Market Structure, Price Action & Trading Strategies, published in 2012 by John Wiley & Sons. 
Adam is also a contributing author for several publications on quantitative finance and related topics, and is much in demand as a speaker and lecturer on the topics of technical trading, risk management, and system development.

Adam is also an accomplished musician, having worked as a professional composer, and classical keyboard artist specializing in historically-informed performance practices. He is also a classically-trained French chef, having served a formal apprenticeship with chef Richard Blondin, a disciple of Paul Bocuse.



In this video, we talk about all of the common issues that people are faced with when embarking on a trading journey right through to becoming consistently profitable.

The underlying message in this video is that successful trading isn't about the golden system. Its about the learning process. Its about understanding the fundamentals of reading price, building and developing a system that suits your personality and being persistent.


In this video Adam goes over:

1) Want to trade - The importance of knowing why you are doing it. He explains how he decided to be more of a swing trader because he didn't want to be in front of the charts every day . His passion is cooking and music. Trading was a vehicle for him to concentrate more on his passions.

2) Expectations - How long the process should take. Adam found out the hard way and believes that most traders become consistently profitable after 3 years of trading.

3) Accountability - Having the right people around you. Talk to people about trading and be open with friends and family even if they don't want to hear it. Teaching makes you a better trader.

4) Learn - The correct process of learning. Don't jump around. Stick to a system and develop it. Adam still trades a system close to what he learnt in the early days with some discretionary development.

5) Trading - Building discretion and improving. Work on your craft constantly.

6) Have & Help - Results, helping others and education. Adam now advises people on asset management and runs Talon advisors.

In this video, we‚Äôll tell you about 10 of the most mysterious and bewildering places on Earth that even scientists can‚Äôt explain! Magnetic Hill, Skeleton Lake, Boiling River and a Dancing Forest.

SUMMARY
-Every year when the snow and frozen water melt, Roopkund Lake in the Himalayas reveals 300 skeletons dumped in it.
-The Hessdalen Lights occasionally turn yellowish or reddish, and nobody knows what makes them change color.
-Canadian fur trapper Joe Labelle came to a village located on the shore of Lake Anjikuni to find it completely deserted.
-Some folks call the Devil's Sea the Pacific Bermuda Triangle since ships and planes tend to disappear there with the same regularity as its North Atlantic counterpart.
-The Lake Michigan Triangle has been gaining its notorious reputation since 1891 when a ship disappeared in its waters, along with its crew of seven sailors.
-If you turn off the engine of your car and leave it in neutral on the Magnetic Hill, your vehicle will start climbing ahead, possibly at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
-About a mile before the river empties into Lake Superior, a rocky outcrop splits it in two. And while the eastern flow drops 50 feet down and keeps flowing into the lake, the western part travels 10 feet down into a giant hole... and vanishes.
-Located in Siberia, the Patomskiy Crater is described as a mound with a perfectly circular shape. It‚Äôs as big as a 25-story building, sits right in the middle of a wooded area with its top chopped off, and presents quite a sight.
-The Boling River really is steaming hot. At a temperature of 187¬∞F, it‚Äôs not exactly boiling, but it‚Äôs pretty close.
-Located on the thin Curonian Spit that divides the Baltic Sea from the Curonian Lagoon is one of the strangest places on Earth. The pine trees in this forest have shockingly unusual shapes: they twist in spirals and circles along the ground.

A disaster is looming.  A fabulous city, rich in culture, and technological advances, is about to be destroyed.  Buildings, people, an entire civilisation, swept away by an overwhelming natural disaster.  The legend has entranced scientists and scholars for centuries.

In this episode Naked Science goes in search of the most enduring myth of all - The City of Atlantis - lost beneath the waves to a massive natural cataclysm some 11,000 years ago.  We know very little of Atlantis, in fact were it not for the writings of the Greek philosopher Plato we might not have encountered it at all.  Plato, recounting a story he heard as a child, described a huge metropolis, rich in fine art, architecture and culture.  The city was destroyed in the space of a day and a night, sunk beneath the waves for eternity by a massive natural cataclysm.  For thousands of years the tale remained an obscure yet tantalising fable until an American by the name of Ignatius Donnelly reignited the idea, bringing it to worldwide attention and sending archaeologists and trophy hunters alike across the globe in its wake.",Science

833,HsQR1lkBzeg,7 Mysterious Discoveries Scientists Can't Explain,"There are amazing discoveries that made the smartest scientists scratch their heads for years. These experts spend their whole lives searching for answers to some of the world‚Äôs biggest mysteries. Yet some of their findings defy logic and are still waiting to be solved.

TIMESTAMPS:
The Maine Penny 
Gold Spirals 
Alaska Artifact 
Rujm el-Hiri 
Mohenjo-Daro 
Longyou Caves 
Swimming Reindeer 

 

Music by Epidemic Sound   

SUMMARY: 
- The coin was made between 1605 and 1093 during the reign of King Olaf III. But how did a silver Norse coin, the only Norse artifact discovered at the site, travel all the way to Maine?
- Flemming and other researchers assumed that these gold spirals were part of a priest-king‚Äôs costume or headwear, which would have been worn during ritual sun ceremonies.
- The buckle-like object had been cast in a mold with a small leather ring attached to the bar, and it was about 2‚Äù by 1‚Äù. Thanks to its leather material, the researchers were able to estimate how old the object is through radiocarbon analysis: it‚Äôs 1,500 years old.
- Rujim el-Hiri is another remnant of the Bronze Age, and it dates back to an estimated 3000 to 2700 BCE. The megalithic structure is located in Golan Heights and is made from approximately 44,000 tons of basalt stones. 
- Mohenjo-Daro can rival the greatness of ancient Rome, though it didn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúcentral seat of government or evidence of a king or queen‚Äù according to a National Geographic article. 
- The Longyou Caves in Zhejiang province, China, aren‚Äôt your ordinary caves with cavernous passages, stalagmites, and stalactites. The 2,000-year-old man-made caves consist of 36 grottoes covering approximately 32,000 sq ft.
- The Swimming Reindeer is made from the tip of a mammoth tusk that is 8‚Äù long. The sculptor possessed extraordinary creativity and skill: it was beautifully crafted with great detail using only stone tools.

The Myth Of the Traumatized Neanderthal
 
‚ÄúAlmost every reasonably complete Neanderthal skeleton that was found during the subsequent century had at least one sign of physical trauma. Some researchers attributed these lesions to fights, others to attacks by predators. But whatever the precise reason, scientists collectively inferred that Neanderthals must have lived short, stressful, and harsh lives.‚Äù 

A new study further undermines the myth of the ‚Äúsavage‚Äù Neanderthal
 
‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs a new paper out in Nature from researchers at the University of T√ºbingen in Germany containing evidence that dispels the notion that Neanderthals were big into skull cracking. The study compared 295 Neanderthal skull pieces, from individuals who lived between 20,000 and 80,000 years ago, to 541 contemporaneous humans (i.e. people like you and me) living in Eurasia. And lo and behold, both groups had roughly the same amount of head trauma.‚Äù

Similar cranial trauma prevalence among Neanderthals and Upper Palaeolithic modern humans
 
‚ÄúNeanderthals are commonly depicted as robust hominins who led stressful, dangerous lives. Traumatic injuries, considered to be common among remains of adult Neanderthals,, are a major piece of evidence supporting this hypothesis: not only are Neanderthals pro-posed to suffer from a high prevalence of trauma, but they are also thought to exhibit more traumatic injuries than early modern humans.‚Äù

But there is actually a substantial body of evidence to support the idea of reincarnation, and though it has remained on the fringes of mainstream scientific thought, it promises to overthrow a number of common assumptions about consciousness and the nature of the human mind.

How do you take a picture of a black hole and what can we learn from it? Our first ever actual bona fide photo of a black hole, made by the Event Horizon Telescope and revealed to the world in a press conference on April 10th. Since then it‚Äôs got plenty of coverage, because ‚Ä¶ I mean look at it. It‚Äôs a freaking black hole. It‚Äôs black, it‚Äôs holey, it‚Äôs everything we hoped it would be. Now that the giddiness has subsided and I personally have stopped spending hours on end staring at a black spot, we can take a breath and actually look at the real science here and discuss exactly how a picture like this could be taken and what we can learn from it.

Need a Black Hole Refresher

Written by Matt O'Dowd
Graphics by Murilo Ceasar Lopes
Directed by Andrew Kornhaber
Produced By: Kornhaber Brown

So, how do you take a picture of a black hole? The beast in question is the supermassive black hole in the center of this ‚Äì the M87 elliptical galaxy. It has an estimated mass of several billion times that of the Sun, which gives it an event horizon larger than the solar system. M87 is 53 million light years away, so resolving that black hole is equivalent to resolving a grain of stand on the beach in LA ‚Äì if you‚Äôre standing in New York. By comparison, the Hubble Space Telescope would struggle to see a large watermelon over that distance.

859,i8Zo1_FN6x,Naked Science - Colliding Continents,"Subscribe to Naked Science - http://goo.gl/wpc2Q1

Every other Wednesday we present a new video, so join us to see the truth laid bare...

How were the continents formed?

We walk over them without a second thought, but where did the land beneath our feet come from?  We go back in time to the oldest rocks on earth, to see how the first continents formed on our fledgling planet.  We see how continents are just lighter rocks, floating on a layer of denser molten rock, the mantle.

Travelling to the bottom of the Grand Canyon we follow the process of erosion and sedimentation that created the landscape we see today.  At the Giant‚Äôs Causeway, in Ireland, we tell the story of how a continent split into two, creating America and Europe, and in the Himalayas, we see how two continents colliding create the tallest mountains on earth.

But what of the future?  Using computer simulations, we trace the progress of the continents over the next 250 million years and discover that they will all merge into one.",Science

So maybe we can't outrun cheetahs or antelope, but humans are uniquely adapted for long distance running. What does science have to say about marathon running? To find out, (and because I was feeling a little crazy) I decided to run one!

Here's what I discovered about the science of long distance running

Description: http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fa...

Meredith L. Patterson, Sergey: The Science of Insecurity

Why is the overwhelming majority of common networked software still not secure, despite all effort to the contrary? Why is it almost certain to get exploited so long as attackers can craft its inputs? Why is it the case that no amount of effort seems to be enough to fix software that must speak certain protocols?

The answer to these questions is that for many protocols and services currently in use on the Internet, the problem of recognizing and validating their ""good"", expected inputs from bad ones is either not well-posed or is undecidable (i. e., no algorithm can exist to solve it in the general case), which means that their implementations cannot even be comprehensively tested, let alone automatically checked for weaknesses or correctness. The designers' desire for more functionality has made these protocols effectively unsecurable.

In this talk we'll draw a direct connection between this ubiquitous insecurity and basic computer science concepts of Turing completeness and theory of languages. We will show how well-meant protocol designs are doomed to their implementations becoming clusters of 0-days, and will show where to look for these 0-days. We will also discuss simple principles of how to avoid designing such protocols.",Science

Darwin's theory of biological evolution helps us understand how simple life forms can give rise to complex lifeforms, but how did the first reproducing creatures come about? The origin of life needs its own explanation.

Scientists don't currently have a complete explanation for life's origins, but different labs around the globe are looking into the idea that life may have emerged from chemistry. In this animation you will learn why they are studying this idea, and you'll get to see a few of the fascinating things they have discovered.

873,O0Uzy35uJzU,The Science of Sleep: Melatonin to Neural Pathways,"Russell Foster, Debra Skene and Stafford Lightman discuss the science of sleep. Why do we need sleep and what are the physiological processes driving our circadian rhythm? When is our circadian clock disrupted and how does this affect our health? Cognitive neuroscientist Vincent Walsh chairs the debate.
Subscribe for regular science videos: 

The science behind sleeplessness can help us understand our rhythms so we can live better and healthier lives. While hormones, such a melatonin, play a role in driving our circadian clock, the amount of sleep we get and our sleep cycles also affect our hormonal release patterns, with far-reaching implications on our health.

Cognitive neuroscientist Vincent Walsh chairs a discussion with a panel of experts who specialise in circadian rhythms. They explore how light detection plays a role in our sleep-wake cycles, how hormone release is regulated and the implications of changes to our circadian clock and sleeplessness over time.

This event was supported by British Psychological Society and Society for Endocrinology.

Russell Foster is Professor of Circadian Neuroscience at the University of Oxford. The research interests of his group range across visual neuroscience, circadian rhythms and sleep.
You can buy his book ""The Rhythms Of Life"" now - 

Debra Skene is Professor of Neuroendocrinology at the University of Surrey. She leads the research group 'Sleep, Chronobiology and Addiction' and her research focusses on links between human circadian clocks, sleep and metabolism in health, circadian disorders and metabolic diseases.

Stafford Lightman is Professor of Medicine at Bristol University. Researching the mechanisms of stress-related disease, his research has particularly looked at how neuroendocrine rhythms signal to other tissues in the body.

BIO:
Rupert Sheldrake, Ph.D. (born 28 June 1942) is a biologist and author of more than 80 scientific papers and ten books. A former Research Fellow of the Royal Society, he studied natural sciences at Cambridge University, where he was a Scholar of Clare College, took a double first class honours degree and was awarded the University Botany Prize. He then studied philosophy and history of science at Harvard University, where he was a Frank Knox Fellow, before returning to Cambridge, where he took a Ph.D. in biochemistry. He was a Fellow of Clare College, Cambridge, where he was Director of Studies in biochemistry and cell biology. As the Rosenheim Research Fellow of the Royal Society, he carried out research on the development of plants and the ageing of cells in the Department of Biochemistry at Cambridge University.

While at Cambridge, together with Philip Rubery, he discovered the mechanism of polar auxin transport, the process by which the plant hormone auxin is carried from the shoots towards the roots.

From 1968 to 1969, based in the Botany Department of the University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, he studied rain forest plants. From 1974 to 1985 he was Principal Plant Physiologist and Consultant Physiologist at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) in Hyderabad, India, where he helped develop new cropping systems now widely used by farmers. While in India, he also lived for a year and a half at the ashram of Fr Bede Griffiths in Tamil Nadu, where he wrote his first book, A New Science of Life.

From 2005-2010 he was the Director of the Perrott-Warrick Project funded from Trinity College,Cambridge. He is a Fellow of Schumacher College , in Dartington, Devon, a Fellow of the Institute of Noetic Sciences near San Francisco, and a Visiting Professor at the Graduate Institute in Connecticut.

He lives in London with his wife Jill Purce and two sons.

He has appeared in many TV programs in Britain and overseas, and was one of the participants (along with Stephen Jay Gould, Daniel Dennett, Oliver Sacks, Freeman Dyson and Stephen Toulmin) in a TV series called A Glorious Accident, shown on PBS channels throughout the US. He has often taken part in BBC and other radio programmes. He has written for newspapers such as the Guardian, where he had a regular monthly column, The Times, Sunday Telegraph, Daily Mirror, Daily Mail, Sunday Times, Times Educational Supplement, Times Higher Education Supplement and Times Literary Supplement, and has contributed to a variety of magazines, including New Scientist, Resurgence, the Ecologist and the Spectator.

875,x6pYAiRqhi,Spirit Science 13 ~ The Crystal Movie,"We've created crystal infused Chakra clothes, just for you! Raise your vibration with Spirit Shirts today! https://spiritsciencecentral.com/spir...

To understand how crystals work, it‚Äôs important to embody the understanding that everything is fundamentally one energy, everything vibrates together in a great unified quantum field. 

This comes up within almost every episode because it relates to literally everything in existence. 

Seeing that everything can be seen as an extension of ourselves, crystals are exactly that. They are conductors, transmuters and channelers of energy. 

Each one has their own geometric lattice, and thus, their own particular radiant energy.

878,z-EtmaFJieY,Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence: Crash Course Computer Science #34,"So we've talked a lot in this series about how computers fetch and display data, but how do they make decisions on this data? From spam filters and self-driving cars, to cutting edge medical diagnosis and real-time language translation, there has been an increasing need for our computers to learn from data and apply that knowledge to make predictions and decisions. This is the heart of machine learning which sits inside the more ambitious goal of artificial intelligence. We may be a long way from self-aware computers that think just like us, but with advancements in deep learning and artificial neural networks our computers are becoming more powerful than ever.

Sword was constructed with Damascus steel. The strength, flexibility and wave-like patterns made them completely unique.  It is a fact that they could cut a silk veil in the air, and they could slice a rock without damaging the blade's sharpness.

+ The Voynich Manuscript 
Wilfrid Voynich, a Lithuanian antiquarian of Polish origin got a manuscript by an anonymous author. The content of this manuscript is still unknown.  botany, biology, and astrology.

+ The Antikythera Mechanism
It is is actually a 2000 years old analog computer. The Antikythera mechanism was recovered from the bottom of the sea in 1901, near Antikythera island, Greece.

+ Zhang Hang Seismograph
Zhang-Hang, a Chinese scientist, and an astronomer from the East Han Dynasty presented this seismoscope in the year 132AD.  It is a copper vessel with dragon heads aiming at the cardinal points.

+ Ulfberht Sword
Many tombs from the Viking age have been discovered all over the north of Europe. Archaeologists have found inside the tombs a total of 171 Ulfberht swords. These swords were made with techniques that were very advanced for that age. They got their name from the inscription +ULFBERHT+ on their blades.

+ The Iron Pillar of Delhi
This iron pillar, weighing six tonnes and 7.21 meters high, which has not rusted during more than 1600 years, it is still an engineering mystery, located in Delhi, India.

+ The Phaistos Disc
  Luigi Pernier, an Italian archaeologist, discovered the Phaistos disc on the Greek island of Crete in 1908. This disc, also known as the Rosetta stone of the Minoan civilization, and made from baked clay.

+ Roman Dodecahedron
One of those mysteries is the Roman dodecahedron. It dates back to 200 years AD. It is a hollow object with 12 sides, made-up of brass or stone.

+ Giant Stone Spheres 
More than 500 pre-Columbian stone spheres were discovered in the Sierpe district, in the south of Costa Rica in 1939. The size of the stones ranges from 30 to 257, and they weigh between two kilos and 16 tonnes.

Won't they be impressed: I'm not a moron!
See how I change this peaceful test...
...into something that'll kill this pest!
Hmm... my compliments, from me to you!
Heh... I can't believe you actually made it through!
Now would you just stay there please!?
I'd like to introduce you to...

...we're making science now!
Making science! Making science!
La! La! La!
It's finally here...
...and we can't wait!
So lock and load and take your aim!

Summary:  I built a rock skipping robot with the help of my nieces and nephews to understand the perfect way to skip a rock.  In the end we learned that 4 things matter most:

1) Rock angle of 20 degrees
2) Rock PATH angle of 20 degrees
3) Spin the rock as much as possible
4) Choose a rock that is flat on the bottom and as heavy as possible for you to still get to your max arm speed.

897,q3kSW633bsk,"$250,000 for a High School Science Student","The story of three impressive high school science projects. Can you guess which student won $250,000 in the #RegeneronSTS? Applications open June 1:  This video was sponsored by Regeneron. The Science Talent Search was founded and produced by the Society for Science and the Public.

Huge thanks to the students: Ronak Roy, Ana Humphrey, and Anjali Chadha. It was great getting to meet all of you and learn about your original scientific research.

Special thanks to Assistant Professor Konstantin Batygin for discussing Ana's research and Planet 9 with me. More is coming on the Planet 9 front.

Ronak came up with a new design for the phoropter, the device used to determine eye-glass prescriptions. It's basically been unchanged for 200 years. Using a liquid lens, he miniaturized the device and wrote an algorithm to determine your prescription.

Ana used math and physics to search for hidden exoplanets. There are a number of reasons why the transit method and Kepler telescope may have missed them: they're too small, too inclined, or take too long to orbit and so were not seen. By considering which planetary systems have additional space for more planets, Ana came up with 560 locations where we may look again for planets in future.

Anjali developed an internet enabled device for measuring arsenic concentrations in drinking water. The device performs several chemical reactions to release the arsenic into a measurable state. It then reacts the arsenic with a test strip to produce a color output. This color is sampled by a camera and processed to determine the concentration of arsenic in the water sample. This has significant potential applications around the world helping reduce exposure to arsenic and potentially other contaminants.

911,VtCO84MDj8,Khan Academy and the Effectiveness of Science Videos,"My PhD: http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/super/...
It is a common view that ""if only someone could break this down and explain it clearly enough, more students would understand."" Khan Academy is a great example of this approach with its clear, concise videos on science. However it is debatable whether they really work. Research has shown that these types of videos may be positively received by students. They feel like they are learning and become more confident in their answers, but tests reveal they haven't learned anything. The apparent reason for the discrepancy is misconceptions. Students have existing ideas about scientific phenomena before viewing a video. If the video presents scientific concepts in a clear, well illustrated way, students believe they are learning but they do not engage with the media on a deep enough level to realize that what was is presented differs from their prior knowledge. There is hope, however. Presenting students' common misconceptions in a video alongside the scientific concepts has been shown to increase learning by increasing the amount of mental effort students expend while watching it.",Science

The notion of beauty and what makes someone beautiful has been debated for centuries. The Han Dynasty in 206 B.C. thought that large eyes were the most beautiful. Ancient Egyptians thought that women with narrow shoulders and high waists were the most aesthetically pleasing. It wasn‚Äôt until the ancient Greeks came up with a formula to calculate the perfect ratio for beauty, that we could have quantitative proof of someone‚Äôs beauty.

The devil's kettle waterfall is believed by some to be a gateway to another universe or even to hell itself. The two streamed waterfall has baffled geologists for decades as no one can work out where the water flowing into the kettle leads. It's as if it simply disappears. But that's not the only mysterious water structure. In the amazon river is now known to be a boiling river hot enough to kill any creature to fall into it. It was thought nothing more than a myth until it's recent discovery and no one knows why the water is hot enough to boil.

In India stands a small village known for having a high twin rate. It's obvious why the settlement is now known as twin town but less obvious why so many twins are born here. Suggested answers include the claim that government experiments secretly changed the genetics of locals decades ago.

Perhaps the most mysterious location is the zone of silence in Mexico, a place known for magnetic phenomena and as a dead zone for radio.

922,D34tEpRF,Time Dilation - Einstein's Theory Of Relativity Explained!,"Time dilation and Einstein‚Äôs theory of relativity go hand in hand. Albert Einstein is the most popular physicist, as he formulated the theory of relativity, which gave the Energy mass equivalence formula and is directly related to time dilation. But what is time dilation? Time dilation and space time are interrelated. Einstein made one of the most important contributions to physics and had the concept of space time explained. A simple explanation of space time is that it is a mathematical model that fuses the three dimensions of space and the one dimension of time into a single four-dimensional continuum. But it is very important to understand that the general theory of relativity and the special theory of relativity are different. In this short animated video, we give a simple explanation of time dilation and Einstein‚Äôs theory of relativity and also explain how time slows down in a moving vehicle!

929,r6w2M50_Xdk,Science Saved My Soul.,"Yes, some of the thinkers to whom I owe my mental freedom were religious, like Newton, a Christian who believed God made the Earth - but showed me why the Earth would have formed without a god's help, or Faraday, who opened all our eyes to electromagnetism - and a world of electrons that obey dice, not gods. The brilliance and physical insight of these and many other religious scientists' minds are the very things that make gods getting humans pregnant, or angels whispering to prophets in caves, seem infantile. 

Weird...

....I can see what geniuses said they could not - but then even a mouse on a giant's shoulder sees further if the giant is bowed in prayer.

I'm not against the Creator or Creators, if they exist, if they ever existed. I'm not against the search for the Creator(s). What blows MY mind is that people think organized religion has anything to do with it at all.

About Atomic School:
Atomic School supports the teaching of Atomic Theory to primary school & science students .
We provide lesson plans, hands-on classroom resources, demonstration equipment, quizzes and a Teacher's Manual to primary school teachers. Animated videos that clearly explain the scientific ideas supports learning by both teachers and students. As a teacher, you don't have to look anywhere else to implement this program.

Our work has been verified by science education researchers at the University of Southern Queensland, Dr Jenny Donovan and Dr Carole Haeusler, who confirm that primary students are capable of learning much more complex scientific concepts than previously thought, and crucially, that they love it. Students run to class!

The program has been trialed in Australian schools as well as schools in the Philippines, Iran and India. It is conducted as holiday workshops at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, the Queensland Museum as well as the World Science Festival.
It has attracted wide media interest, including TV, radio and print, and the research data has been presented at prestigious American Education Research Association and Australian Science Education Research Association conferences. 

Atomic Theory underlies all the other sciences- genetics, electronics, nanotechnology, engineering and astronomy- so an early understanding will set them up for a more successful learning sequence for all their science subjects, and support their mastery of mathematics as well. We also have extension programs that cover Biology, Physics and Astronomy to an equal depth.



About Ian Stuart (Email: ian.douglas.stuart@gmail.com):
The founder of Atomic School, Ian Stuart, taught Chemistry and Physics for 25 years at senior levels before he realized that his 8-year old son, Tom, could understand Atomic Theory at a much deeper level than he expected. After visiting Tom's class at school, he discovered that his peers could also grasp the abstract scientific concepts, as well as apply it usefully to the real world.

Ian then developed a program to teach the advanced concepts of high school Chemistry, Physics and Biology to students 10 years younger than they normally would. He found that this engaged their interest in modern science early, and sustained it through to high school and beyond. It also sets them up for future success in their academic and career paths.

Ian has a Bachelor's Degree in Chemistry from the University of Queensland and a Master's degree in Electrochemistry from the University of Melbourne.

Video transcript:",Science
934,d8s8e8JdGC,The Science of Dubstep | James Humberstone | TEDxOxford,"The theme for TEDxOxford in 2016 was ‚Äúfind X‚Äù. In his talk ‚Äúthe Science of Dubstep‚Äù, James Humberstone proposes that if this and future generations are going to ‚Äúfind X‚Äù, every nation needs to revolutionise education and develop cohorts of workers who can think abstractly. A composer, technologist, musicologist and music educator, Humberstone claims that music is the most abstract of all the arts and that technologically rich, culturally appropriate musical training could lead that educational revolution, turning the focus away from high stakes standardised testing and toward engaging and inspiring student-centred learning. Along the way he explains how incredible human perception of sound is, and composes a 12-tone dubstep song with the help of the TED audience!

As a composer, technologist and teacher, James Humberstone believes that music education can lead all education through the challenges of the 21st Century. After all, there is no more experiential, creative, child-centred subject than music ‚Äì or so he claims. A trained ‚Äòclassical‚Äô composer, James migrated to Sydney, Australia in 1997 and has also worked in the fields of music software, education (with children and adults of all ages), and as a musicologist. Today he is a lecturer in music education at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music, and remains an active composer. His recent musical output included a permanent electro-acoustic installation at the Australian National Maritime Museum on board a retired destroyer and a submarine. In 2016 James is collaborating on a Hip Hop album, and composing a song cycle. He has also just released the University of Sydney‚Äôs first (free) MOOC, ‚ÄúThe Place of Music in 21st Century Education‚Äù at www.coursera.org.

943,QuHr3ErT34I,Naked Science - Death of the Sun,"Subscribe to Naked Science - http://goo.gl/wpc2Q1

Every other Wednesday we present a new video, so join us to see the truth laid bare...

The Sun is the most powerful force in our solar system.  It generates the heat and light that sustains us.  Without it we wouldn‚Äôt have life on Earth.  But the Sun is violent and volatile and is becoming more dangerous as it ages.

Naked Science explores the life and death of the Sun.  We explore what will happen in the future as the Sun ages, and how our lives linked to the Sun‚Äôs life cycle.

Firstly we want to understand how the Sun was created from a giant cloud of dust and gas.  Scientists pretty much agree on the theory but physical evidence is hard to come by.  Naked Science meets scientists at Johnson Space Center who have been working on a ten year mission to bring a piece of the Sun back to Earth.  How do scientists collect samples of the Sun when a probe could never get near the Sun‚Äôs surface?  We follow NASA‚Äôs dare devil mission to capture the samples.

Today we rely on the Sun to live.  It‚Äôs energy fuels trees and plants which are essential for the food chain we all depend upon.  But how do we get the energy?  Naked Science explores the incredible journey that the particles of light from the Sun have to make to earth to deliver their energy.

How old is the Sun?  This is a question which has fascinated scientists for a long time.  Scientists have now established the Sun‚Äôs age with the aid of one remarkable fact that the Sun sings.  We visit Big Bear Solar Observatory in California to meet one of the scientists who has been at the forefront of using the Sun‚Äôs sounds to determine its age.

The Sun‚Äôs warmth and light helped life on Earth to begin but it can also play havoc with our modern way of life.  Billions of tons of plasma erupting from the sun send powerful storms hurtling through our solar system.  We visit the Space Environment Center in Boulder, Colorado where they try to predict the sun‚Äôs violent moods.  1989 brought one of the most dramatic space storms and Naked Science uncovers the events which took place on the Earth.  But what lies behind the explosive events on the Sun.  We travel to the California Institute of Technology in Los Angeles where they are trying to understand the science behind the explosions by creating them in the laboratory.

But what about the risks of solar storms to astronauts in Space?  Naked Science meets Michael Foale who was directly in the line of fire on the International Space Station during the intense solar activity in 2003.  There is one solar event astronauts can‚Äôt be protected from.  A superflare.  Superflares are up to 10 million times more energetic than the most powerful solar flares.  Naked Science journeys to Louisiana to meet an astrophysicist who has found evidence of nine stars that have experienced superflares.  What if our sun ever produced a superflare, what would happen to life on earth?

We know when the sun was born, how it nurtured us and how it has thrown a fair amount of danger our way.  But how and when will it die and will the Earth survive?",Science

For more than 60 years, the UCSF Willed Body Program has overseen the donation of bodies for medical education and research. Andrew Corson, director of the UCSF Willed Body Program, talks about the program, which is the largest such program in the state, receiving approximately 400 donated bodies a year. Cadavers donated to UCSF are supplied to a number of programs including UCSF's School of Medicine, School of Dentistry and School of Pharmacy, as well as the orthopedics, ophthalmology, otolaryngology and physical therapy departments. Additionally, UCSF provides cadavers to other UC campuses and approximately 50 non-UC schools in Northern California, research groups and emergency medical education programs.

Genetic engineering used to be thought of as a fantasy. The ability to change what an animal is at its core was thought to be immoral and likely not even possible. But through science, it seems that every experiment in modified genetics is just a matter of time until success. When a scientist sits down in their lab, they are able to create some scary stuff! Animals that are usually average all of a sudden become a lesson in biology right in front of your face. For example, a mouse was created with a human appendage on its back and it shocked the world. But not as much as another animal on our list named Dolly. The cartilage was only made to look human however, because it had been injected with parts of a cow as well! Frogs that you would usually dissect in school in the classroom are now beyond that. Scientists have modified them through experiments to become beyond cutting. A sheep became the first mammal of its kind to be cloned! And cloning is no easy task‚Ä¶ Ask any mad scientist from television and movies. The science behind these amazing experiments is incredibly advanced. It‚Äôs almost as if a scientist would need to be mad to complete them! When they get into the lab, anything is possible. 
Once you see these strange animals, you will realize that the future is now. Anytime we thought modifying genetics wasn‚Äôt possible, we have been proven wrong by scientists. So let‚Äôs take a look at the Strange Animals Created by Scientists.

If you‚Äôre ready to find out how the Japanese manage to stay so effortlessly thin, keep our new video!

In Japan, they usually stick to 3 wholesome meals a day that don‚Äôt leave them hungry or dealing with sudden cravings. Those who do snack keep it in small quantities and with a lot of moderation.
Also, the secret to Japan‚Äôs success begins with their diet, which is pretty carb-heavy and low in saturated fats. Their main dishes of choice include vegetables, grains, fish, and meat. Dairy products and fruits are consumed in moderation. They tend to stay away from foods with excessive amounts of salt and sugar, like burgers and soda.

- Just like the rest of the world, a lot of Japanese people have a hectic schedule that doesn‚Äôt leave a lot of time or opportunity to prepare a home-cooked meal. In that case, they can turn to their version of fast food, which is usually a lot healthier and resembles home-style cooking.
- Most Japanese people have very regulated meal times. They eat 3 filling meals a day, with breakfast usually happening between 8 and 9am, lunch from 12 to 1pm, and dinner between 6 and 8pm.
- It‚Äôs a lot more common for Japanese children to walk or cycle to school. Of course, other countries have a lot of reasons why it might not be efficient or safe for kids to hoof it to class.
- Portion sizes have been on a steep rise in the last 20 years throughout the world. For example, countries like Australia, Canada, Germany, the U.S., and the U.K. have much larger fast food portions than Japan.
- Separate bicycle lanes and plenty of safe areas for pedestrians are common sites in Japan. This allows the Japanese to naturally burn calories as they commute to and from work or school every day.
- Tea, especially the green variety, is the number one beverage in Japan. Green tea has been praised for having a ton of major health benefits, like increasing metabolism, burning fat, fighting anxiety, and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, to name a few.
- The practice of using chopsticks also helps in weight management, since they make you eat more slowly and in smaller bites. This slow process of eating helps people catch when they‚Äôre feeling full and avoid eating too much. The fact that food is served on a bunch of plates also slows down the process.
- The number one way that the Japanese stay thin has to do with removing distractions and being mindful about the process of food consumption. Eating in Japan is treated with respect.

In 2020, 1.4 million new jobs will be available for those with competing backgrounds, but we‚Äôll only have engineers to fill two-thirds of them. Ashley shows us how we can right this wrong.

Ashley Gavin is a computer science education consultant with a passion for making computer science curricula empowering, accessible, and above all, fun. Her work in curriculum and program development serves as the foundation for some of the finest educational organizations in the country including her brainchild ‚ÄúGirls Who Code‚Äù.

During high school, Ashley was actively interested in tech. However, she was denied access to computer science courses at her school due her failing grades in math and science. In her senior year, the newly appointed CS teacher noticed her affinity for tech and took a risk by letting her drop math and take computer science instead. Ashley has since been working to do so for as many students as possible, especially those in underrepresented groups.

This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",Science

Lyrics:

[Sagan]
If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch
You must first invent the universe

Space is filled with a network of wormholes
You might emerge somewhere else in space
Some when-else in time

The sky calls to us
If we do not destroy ourselves
We will one day venture to the stars

A still more glorious dawn awaits
Not a sunrise, but a galaxy rise
A morning filled with 400 billion suns
The rising of the milky way

The Cosmos is full beyond measure of elegant truths
Of exquisite interrelationships 
Of the awesome machinery of nature

I believe our future depends powerfully 
On how well we understand this cosmos
In which we float like a mote of dust
In the morning sky

But the brain does much more than just recollect
It inter-compares, it synthesizes, it analyzes 
it generates abstractions

The simplest thought like the concept of the number one 
Has an elaborate logical underpinning
The brain has its own language
For testing the structure and consistency of the world

[Hawking]
For thousands of years
People have wondered about the universe
Did it stretch out forever
Or was there a limit

From the big bang to black holes
From dark matter to a possible big crunch
Our image of the universe today
Is full of strange sounding ideas

[Sagan}
How lucky we are to live in this time
The first moment in human history 
When we are in fact visiting other worlds

The surface of the earth is the shore of the cosmic ocean
Recently we've waded a little way out
And the water seems inviting",Science

In 1995, the British Medical Journal published a report about a builder who accidentally jumped onto a nail, which pierced straight through his steel-toed boot. He was in such agonizing pain that any movement was unbearable. But when the doctors took off his boot, they discovered that the nail had never touched his foot at all. What‚Äôs going on? Joshua W.

Chemistry-Bio-Physics-Mathematical
But which field is best?

PHYSICS:

I understand the force and energy
Quantum mechanics and relativity
My field is pure and they rely on me
I see the universe like nobody

You may have made fun of me in high school
For being awkward and following the rules
Now I‚Äôve got laser (WOW, That‚Äôs really cool) 
May the mass times acceleration be you 

Atoms-Entropy-Dark Matter-String Theory

CHEMISTRY:

If you want to feel a bond
Then I can give you a good reaction
The elements that make up life 
Are my essence, are my satisfaction 

All the other fields out there are so basic
Yeah, I‚Äôm the central science
Keep your eye on me
I‚Äôll get you charged

If you need me, call me up on
Avogadro's Number
If you leave me, take a titrant 
Shove it up your acid buffer

Dopamine and serotonin
Will keep you good and happy 
So get your flask and your glass all set up
And begin to understand the world!

BIO:

Within me you‚Äôll find life‚Äôs beauty
In genetics and ecology
Symbiosis and not division
Unless it‚Äôs mitosis or the study of fission

Even if you don‚Äôt pass, at least you‚Äôll enjoy my class!

Evolution, has brung us along
All species singing one song

MATH:

If you want to learn about the world I must say
I am the purest field of study you can take
Immune to misinterpretation
The blueprint of creation 
The backbone of all things science

No bias, just constant augmentation
In your mind, and observation
No gadgets, just your logic and your time

And PIE

ENDING:

Together we will find the answers to life!
With physics-bio-chemistry-and math
We can...SCIENCE!",Science

READ PSYCHOLOGICAL SUPPORT NOTES THAT FOLLOW

This presentation from November 5, 2018 was delivered to the 'Foresight Group' of the EU Commission in Brussels, Belgium. The assessment of our global prospects is extremely severe.  The conclusions may be upsetting and perhaps life-changing for many.  But the conclusions should not be taken in lightly.

PSYCHOLOGICAL SUPPORT NOTES
I chose to keep this video in 'Unlisted' mode for 10 weeks because I felt that it would be a hard pill to swallow for most people, and that some emotional support needed to be provided when I finally presented it.  

Well, now is the time, and I think in a way the set of  programs I produced in Poland at COP-24 ARE the emotional support, especially the ones with Greta Thunberg, our little 'truth-teller' extraordinaire.  So please watch them and Subscribe.

Reality is quite a complex affair.  I hold that we might achieve some measure of what is energetically referred to as 'redemption' if we (individually and collectively) were to 'repent' of our wasteful, abusive ways.  I 'quote' those words since I don't want them to evoke the standard religious interpretations.  I use them more in the sense of morally and energetically re-balancing our psyches in harmony with the natural world.

So watch this video as a though it were an 'oracle' of one possible, perhaps probably future.  Take the questions it raises seriously.  Take them to 'heart', so to speak.  Then be in your heart ('coeur' in French) with courage to face the future with equanimity, and perhaps change the future with your intention and your heart.",Science
965,HZ5mJK4J5Q,10 Extinct Animals Scientists Are Ready to Bring Back,"Do you know that scientists are almost ready to bring back some species that have been long gone? A T-Rex and other dangerous creatures aren't on the VIP list, so we won't see them in the not-so-distant future. But some of our most beloved characters from the Ice Age movies can be brought back to life!

Instead of using the controversial term ‚Äúcloning,‚Äù scientists prefer to say ‚Äúmake un-extinct.‚Äù To-may-to, to-mah-to, the idea is the same. An animal that died out thousands of years ago can't be brought back to life unless it's cloned. And therein lies the problem. For successful cloning, scientists need to have almost completely undamaged animal DNA. That's why some species are more likely to be resurrected than others. 
 
TIMESTAMPS: 
The woolly mammoth 
The saber-toothed tiger 
The Moa 
The ground sloth 
The dodo 
Woolly rhinoceros 
The Irish elk 
The Baiji river dolphin 
The Siberian unicorn 
The Neanderthal  

Music: 

SUMMARY:
- While most of the woolly mammoths died out about 10,000 years ago, there was a population of about 500 to 1,000 of them living on Wrangel Island as recent as 1650 B.C.E. The woolly mammoth was roughly the size of an African elephant.
- The saber-toothed tiger was about the size of your typical modern-day big cats. It weighed from 200 to 600 pounds and could get up to 13 feet long. The saber-toothed tiger usually had a muscular neck, bobbed tail, powerful front legs, and dagger-like teeth that protruded from the upper jaw and could grow just under a foot long!   
- The moa was a huge flightless bird that looked kinda like an ostrich, minus the wings. We know of about 10 members of the moa family. Some were no bigger than a turkey while others reached a height of 10 feet, making this bird the largest that has ever inhabited our planet.  
- Ground sloths are likely to be successfully resurrected since they were still walking the Earth about 8,000 years ago. Even better, some samples of their DNA have already been received from undamaged hairs of this animal. 
- The dodo became extinct just 80 years after it had been discovered. Its only known habitat was Mauritius Island, where the dodo had been living peacefully for who knows how long until the Dutch showed up in the 1590s.
- Besides the woolly mammoth, there‚Äôs one more fluffy extinct creature, the woolly rhinoceros, that scientists want to bring back. This animal still lived in the Arctic snows pretty recently, about 10,000 years ago. This furry rhino is quite famous too; it often makes an appearance in ancient cave art, like in the French Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc Cave. 
- The Irish elk, also called the giant deer, was one more animal that didn't quite manage to survive the Ice Age. This creature mostly died out about 12,000 years ago. But researchers have discovered Irish elk fossils in Siberia that are only 7,000 to 8,000 years old.  
- The Baiji river dolphin went extinct in 2006, making it the first cetacean (that‚Äôs whales, dolphins, and porpoises) to die out directly due to the negative impact of human activity. It's obvious by now that since the extinction is quite recent, there‚Äôs a sea of DNA samples at hand that make resurrection pretty much a guaranteed success. 
- A Siberian unicorn skull discovered in Kazakhstan proved that the animal had actually disappeared just 29,000 years ago. That‚Äôs good news for people who wanna see a real unicorn someday! 
- Bringing the Neanderthal back would be the easiest task of them all. Scientists already have a map of its genome. It‚Äôs not a question of whether or not we can, but if we should‚Ä¶

The problem was the textbook: it was impossible to understand. He delivers a rousing call for science teachers to ditch the jargon and extreme precision, and instead make science sing through stories and demonstrations. (Filmed at TEDxBeaconStreet.)

Summary:  I collected data at the carnival for a full day.  Then I used that information to figure out which games are the biggest scams using science to analyze them and show you how to beat them.  I also figured out how much the carnival actually pays for the prizes so even if you win, you lose.  And then I visited the carnival with my professional baseball playing buddy to dominate all the games.  It worked well.

Register for Science and Cooking from HarvardX at .

About this course: 
During each week of the course, you will watch as chefs reveal the secrets behind some of their most famous culinary creations ‚Äî often right in their own restaurants. Inspired by such cooking mastery, the Harvard team will then explain, in simple and sophisticated ways, the science behind the recipe.

Topics will include: soft matter materials, such as emulsions, illustrated by aioli; elasticity, exemplified by the done-ness of a steak; and diffusion, revealed by the phenomenon of spherification, the culinary technique pioneered by Ferran Adri√†.

To help you make the link between cooking and science, an ""equation of the week"" will capture the core scientific concept being explored. You will also have the opportunity to be an experimental scientist in your very own laboratory ‚Äî your kitchen. By following along with the engaging recipe of the week, taking measurements, and making observations, you will learn to think both like a cook and a scientist. The lab is also one of the most unique components of this course ‚Äî after all, in what other science course do you get to eat your lab?

Many things are done in the name of science. There is a need to advance our technology, in order to provide food for a growing world population, or to provide medicine and cures for sickness and disease. From see through animals, to clones, and even one wild and crazy idea, take a look at our list of 10 Animals Created by Science. 

10. See Through Frog - Frogs come in nearly every color - from the dull greens, to the vivid yellows and reds of their tropical relatives. Some frogs are even transparent and you can see right through them, which is probably what gave Japanese scientists the idea to create a see through frog by bringing together genes from frogs with unusually pale skin. In these frogs their skin is see through in their early lives. What does this mean?

9. Enviropig ‚Äì This might be a little bit gross but the Enviropig was genetically engineered to produce up to less than 65% phosphorous through its urine and feces. Environmentally, pigs are very destructive to the land they are raised on.

8. Killer Bees ‚Äì You might be thinking that killer bees are a natural species. But, what is little known about these creatures is that they were accidently created by scientists who were trying to increase honey production, and instead ended up with a killer bee. 

7. Super Cows ‚Äì The Belgian Supercow is known as somewhat a mutant breed of cattle. It‚Äôs originas date back to the 1800‚Äôs when Belgian scientists and farmers decided to breed native cattle with Shorthorn cattle. 

6. Genpets ‚Äì OK so this isn‚Äôt a real animal created by scientists, but Genpets needs to be in this list and is probably one of the greatest hoaxes in modern history. 

5. Sterile Pink Bollworm ‚Äì The Pink Bollworm is a serious pest when it comes to cotton farming. Not only do the young larvae inflict damage to the cotton plant by their feeding, they chew through the cotton lint to feed on the seeds.

4. GloFish ‚Äì At first it might not seem like these fish are real, but they are. Glofish are a brand of genetically engineered fluorescent fish. 

3. See-Through Goldfish ‚Äì There are a lot of reasons to genetically engineer creatures such as see through rats, see through frogs, and even see through goldfish. 

2. Dolly the Sheep ‚Äì On July 5th 1996, Dolly the Sheep made biotech history when she became the first animal cloned from adult somatic cells. 

1. Pharmaceutical Camels ‚Äì Many people might not know this but camels milk can be used to produce pharmaceutical proteins used in drugs. And by creating genetically modified camels, it‚Äôs a real inexpensive way to produce it.",Science
1003,zm-3kovWpNQ,The protein folding problem: a major conundrum of science: Ken Dill at TEDxSBU,"For 50 years, the ""protein folding problem"" has been a major mystery.  How does a miniature string-like chemical -- the protein molecule - encode the functions of living organisms: how our muscles exert force, how our immune systems reject pathogens, how our eyes see our surroundings, how plants convert solar energy, and all the rest.  Huge progress is being made.  Moreover, these amazing nano-machines could play important roles in health and disease and commerce in the future.

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",Science
1004,SzJ46YA_RaA,Map of Computer Science,"The field of computer science summarised. Learn more at this video's sponsor https://brilliant.org/dos

Computer science is the subject that studies what computers can do and investigates the best ways you can solve the problems of the world with them. It is a huge field overlapping pure mathematics, engineering and many other scientific disciplines. In this video I summarise as much of the subject as I can and show how the areas are related to each other.

A couple of notes on this video:
1. Some people have commented that I should have included computer security alongside hacking, and I completely agree, that was an oversight on my part. Apologies to all the computer security professionals, and thanks for all the hard work!
2. I also failed to mention interpreters alongside compilers in the complier section. Again, I‚Äôm kicking myself because of course this is an important concept for people to hear about. Also the layers of languages being compiled to other languages is overly convoluted, in practice it is more simple than this. I guess I should have picked one simple example.
3. NP-complete problems are possible to solve, they just become very difficult to solve very quickly as they get bigger. When I said NP-complete and then ""impossible to solve"", I meant that the large NP-complete problems that industry is interested in solving were thought to be practically impossible to solve.

1011,0kICLG4Zg8,Noam Chomsky on AI: The Singularity is Science Fiction!,"http://www.singularityweblog.com/noam...

Dr. Noam Chomsky is a famed linguist, political activist, prolific author and recognized public speaker, who has spent the last 60 years living a double life -- one as a political activist and another as a linguist. His activism allegedly made him the US government's public enemy number one. As a linguist he is often credited for dethroning behaviorism and becoming the ""father of modern linguistics"" (and/or cognitive science). Put together his accomplishments are the reasons why he is often listed as one of the most important intellectuals of the 20th century. And so I was very much looking forward to interviewing him on Singularity 1 on 1.

Unfortunately our time together was delayed, then rushed and a bit shorter than anticipated. So I was pretty nervous throughout and messed up some of my questions and timing. Never-the-less, I believe that we still had a worthy conversation with Dr. Chomsky and I appreciate the generous though limited time that he was able to grant me.

During our 28 minute conversation with Noam Chomsky we cover a variety of interesting topics such as: the balance between his academic and his political life; artificial intelligence and reverse engineering the human brain; why in his view both Deep Blue and Watson are little more than PR; the slow but substantial progress of our civilization; the technological singularity...",Science

‚ñ≤Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/WILearned
‚ñ≤Twitter:  

This video will explain why hunger won't get worse and worse while fasting and why keeping your blood glucose and insulin low & why trying a keto diet will help you adapt to fasting a lot easier. 

When I first started doing intermittent fasting, handling the hunger was quite difficult. I tried several things to try and make myself less hungry without breaking the fast, but what was most helpful was knowing that it would go away on its own, and why this was the case. So, I hope that this video helps those of you trying out prolonged or intermittent fasting - hunger is pretty much inescapable, there is going to be some level of discomfort when trying out fasting, but it's very encouraging to know that things will change and hunger will naturally go away. 

Sections:
 - Why hunger is rhythmic & doesn't just get stronger over time
 - Why low Salt may be cause of your hunger while fasting
 - How Insulin works
 - How Glucagon works
 - Insulin Makes you Hungry, Glucagon doesn't
 - Ketones/Ketosis & Hunger
 - Why you shouldn't go overboard on protein
 - Letpin, the satiety hormone

1031,65e2qScV_K8,The science of emotions: Jaak Panksepp at TEDxRainier,"Given an inherent subjective nature, emotions have long been a nearly impenetrable topic for scientific research. Affective neuroscientist Jaak Panksepp explains a modern approach to emotions, and how taking seriously the emotions of other animals might soon improve the lives of millions. 

Jaak Panksepp introduced the concept of Affective Neuroscience in 1990, consisting of an overarching vision of how mammalian brains generate experienced affective states in animals, as effective models for fathoming the primal evolutionary sources of emotional feelings in human beings. This work has implications for further developments in Biological Psychiatry, ranging from an understanding of the underlying brain disorders, to new therapeutic strategies. Panksepp is a Ph.D. Professor and Baily Endowed Chair of Animal Well-Being Science, College of Veterinary Medicine, Washington State University. His scientific contributions include more than 400 papers devoted to the study of basic emotional and motivational processes of the mammalian brain. He has conducted extensive research on brain and bodily mechanisms of feeding and energy-balance regulation, sleep physiology, and most importantly the study of emotional processes, including associated feelings states, in other animals. 

This talk was given November 9, 2013 in Seattle at TEDxRainier, a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences.

Lyrics:

I'll be the spark, if you'll be the flame
Start a reaction that can't be contained
Balance your pH by sharing my base
I'll be your star, if you'll be my space

'Cause there is no distance that I wouldn't go
Through spacetime and wormholes my matter would flow
To the edge of the universe

I'll be your G, if you will be C
Or I can be A, if you will be T
If there's a mutation I'll fix every base
Working as your zinc finger nuclease

Just like an atom, don't rip us apart
Unless you want a big BOOM in my heart

We can take it fast or really slow
But we can't know with certainty where we'll go
If at first we don't succeed, we'll try two more times
So our failure's a statistically significant try

Like an equation, it all works out
If we balance the sides there's no need to doubt

CHORUS:
This is your science love song
A place to start our chemical bond
A research endeavour
We can write the conclusion together

Just like the movies I'd steal your heart
But then you'd die...so I won't do that

If we broke up I'd be no more
I'd give up H2O for H2SO4
Take away gravity, I'd still fall for you
Share my last electron in a covalent bond for two

'Cause you're like that angle, A-cute and you're smart
Your labcoat and goggles go straight to my heart
Except that's a lie, cause the heart doesn't feel
When it comes to love the brain seals the deal

REPEAT CHORUS

'Cause you matter to me",Science

Social anthropologist Jean Smith, or ‚Äòflirtologist‚Äô if you will, demonstrates her 6 simple steps known as ‚ÄúH.O.T.  A.P.E.‚Äù to help answer that very question. And it will forever change your perception of flirting from being a stranger‚Äôs evaluation of your worth into what it should be: a fun game! 

Jean's purpose in life is understanding how people flirt. And people flirt differently in different cultures. She uses her background as a  cultural and social anthropologist to help teach people how to flirt ‚Äì to gain confidence and happiness in their lives by assisting them to projective a positive image of themselves. , she uses research and  studies to emphasize the skills that we can all learn to interact more effectively. Jean also uses practical activities and interaction to bridge the brain and the body and apply the information to make our daily lives more rewarding. The basis of Jeans teachings comes from her background as a social anthropologist.. A few years ago, Jean published, The Flirt Interpreter, which is an accessible analysis of the research she conducted into the flirting behaviour of people in the cities of London, New York, Paris and Stockholm. She conducted 250 face-to-face interviews to ascertain flirting behaviour.

Script:

In 1966 Time magazine ran a cover story asking: ""Is God Dead?"" The cover reflected the fact that many people had accepted the cultural narrative that God is obsolete -- that, as science progresses there is less need for a ""God"" to explain the universe.  It turns out, though, that the rumors of God's death were premature. In fact, perhaps the best arguments for his existence come from -- of all places  -- science itself.

Here's the story: The same year Time featured its now-famous headline, the astronomer Carl Sagan announced that there were two necessary criteria for a planet to support life: The right kind of star, and a planet the right distance from that star. Given the roughly octillion planets in the universe -- that's 1 followed by 24 zeros -- there should have been about septillion planets -- that's 1 followed by 21 zeros -- capable of supporting life.

With such spectacular odds, scientists were optimistic that the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, known by its initials, SETI, an ambitious project launched in the 1960's, was sure to turn up something soon. With a vast radio telescopic network, scientists listened for signals that resembled coded intelligence. But as the years passed, the silence from the universe was deafening. As of 2014, researchers have discovered precisely bubkis, nada, zilch, which is to say zero followed by an infinite number of zeros.

What happened? As our knowledge of the universe increased, it became clear that there were, in fact, far more factors necessary for life -- let alone intelligent life -- than Sagan supposed. His two parameters grew to 10, then 20, and then 50, which meant that the number of potentially life-supporting planets decreased accordingly.  The number dropped to a few thousand planets and kept on plummeting.

Even SETI proponents acknowledged the problem. Peter Schenkel wrote in a 2006 piece for Skeptical Inquirer, a magazine that strongly affirms atheism: ""In light of new findings and insights . . . . We should quietly admit that the early estimates . . . may no longer be tenable.""

Today there are more than 200 known parameters necessary for a planet to support life--every single one of which must be perfectly met, or the whole thing falls apart. For example, without a massive, gravity-rich planet like Jupiter nearby to draw away asteroids, Earth would be more like an interstellar dartboard than the verdant orb that it is.  

Simply put, the odds against life in the universe are astonishing.

Yet here we are, not only existing, but talking about existing. What can account for it? Can every one of those many parameters have been perfectly met by accident? At what point is it fair to admit that it is science itself that suggests that we cannot be the result of random forces?  Doesn't assuming that an intelligence created these perfect conditions in fact require far less faith than believing that a life-sustaining Earth just happened to beat the inconceivable odds?

Simon Peyton Jones wants children not just to consume technology, but to be creative with it. What does that mean for teaching computer science in schools, and why is the rest of the world watching England?

Simon Peyton Jones is a principal researcher at Microsoft Research in Cambridge. His research focus is in programming language design and implementation, and the purely-functional language Haskell in particular. He is a founder member and current chair of the Computing at School working group, which has played a central role in the recent reform of the school Computing curriculum.

At TEDxExeter 2014 our speakers and performers connected us with other worlds. Our talks exposed corruption in big business, shared effective approaches to tackling social inequality and gave a voice to those whose human rights are under threat. We explored the impact of fast changing technologies on all our lives. We journeyed through fire and forest to frozen landscapes. We were challenged to consider worlds of extremes, cutting edge controversies and risky opportunities.

Lyrics:

[deGrasse Tyson]
We are all connected;
To each other, biologically
To the earth, chemically
To the rest of the universe atomically

[Feynman]
I think nature's imagination
Is so much greater than man's
She's never going to let us relax

[Sagan]
We live in an in-between universe
Where things change all right
But according to patterns, rules,
Or as we call them, laws of nature

[Nye]
I'm this guy standing on a planet
Really I'm just a speck
Compared with a star, the planet is just another speck
To think about all of this
To think about the vast emptiness of space
There's billions and billions of stars
Billions and billions of specks

[Sagan]
The beauty of a living thing is not the atoms that go into it
But the way those atoms are put together
The cosmos is also within us
We're made of star stuff
We are a way for the cosmos to know itself

Across the sea of space
The stars are other suns
We have traveled this way before
And there is much to be learned

I find it elevating and exhilarating
To discover that we live in a universe
Which permits the evolution of molecular machines
As intricate and subtle as we

[deGrasse Tyson]
I know that the molecules in my body are traceable
To phenomena in the cosmos
That makes me want to grab people in the street
And say, have you heard this??

(Richard Feynman on hand drums and chanting)

[Feynman]
There's this tremendous mess
Of waves all over in space
Which is the light bouncing around the room
And going from one thing to the other

And it's all really there
But you gotta stop and think about it
About the complexity to really get the pleasure
And it's all really there
The inconceivable nature of nature",Science

- This experiment can be very dangerous and cause serious burns, DO NOT attempt unless you have professional supervision! 
- We used gel fuel because liquid fuel would absorb into the polymer.
- Keep a full bucket of water and hose ready to extinguish the fire. 

Fire Gel Fights House Fires

Fire retardant gel breaks the fire triangle by suffocating the oxygen from the fuel by cooling the heat source, thus breaking the thermal barriers of fire. 

How It Works

When the water-saturated gel is encountered, the heat energy from the fire is redirected and is consumed by first having to drive out all of the entrapped water as steam. This prevents the heat from building up to the point of combustion in the surrounding materials.

Magnesium

Finely divided magnesium readily ignites upon heating in air and burns with a bright white flame.

1080,S20NcDLF_t4,Hardest Computer Science Course Explained | Angel of Death UoG,"Since you guys really liked the last computer science video I decided to talk about my hardest CS course, nicknamed the ""angel of death"" at my school. It has a notoriously high fail rate for its assignments. You can expect to write a few thousand lines of C code in the first two assignments. This year we made a GEDCOM parser (which is actually what ancestry.com uses) to store information about family histories, allowing us to perform operations on family connections. In the second assignment we wrote a GEDCOM file writer, to create a GEDCOM file out of the memory objects. In the third assignment we used Node js and express to create a RESTful web server and UI for interacting with our parser. I tried to explain the file structure as best I could in a few minutes, so it will probably be very confusing to watch at first. The goal is to show you the complexities of the file structure, and how we built this web application to interface with our C API. This is basically how large scale cloud computing applications are made such as YouTube and Facebook.

GEDCOM Standard: 

The point I want to make is that this course is not as ""hard"" as everybody makes it out to be. Just dedicate at least two weeks to the assignment and you will be fine. None of the algorithms or data structures were difficult, rather it was the massive amount of errors possible when writing such a parser from scratch. There are thousands of tags and conditions if you want to create a full parser and identify everything listed in the standard. Thankfully we only implemented about half of the full parser seen on the standard (link above).

|| Technologies used ||

GEDCOM Parser API:
- C

Web server:
- Node js with express framework
- RESTful server, ajax, JSON
- JavaScript

Client:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap

1081,7rm1iP5CzuE,Scientists Reveal 13 Signs of Exceptional Intelligence,"How to understand you are smart? How to become a genius? Here are 13 traits of intelligent people that will help you recognize them without any tests. 

We usually take IQ tests to measure a person‚Äôs mental abilities, but as it‚Äôs not always necessary. It‚Äôs hard to argue with the fact that some of us are smarter than others (yes, there are so FEW of us). It might be offensive, but it is what it is, and there is no denying it. We usually take IQ tests to measure a person‚Äôs mental abilities, but as it turns out, it‚Äôs not always necessary! 

What does it mean if you are a messy person? Can someone lazy be smart? We've got 13 traits of intelligent people that will help you recognize them without any tests. You can use these signs for self-analysis!

TIMESTAMPS
Smart people love cats 
Smart people easily adapt 
You sense when you are being lied to 
You are self-sufficient 
Sometimes you are messy 
You don‚Äôt lie to yourself 
You can hold your emotions when it‚Äôs necessary 
You always make plans 
You like being lazy sometimes 
You don‚Äôt get stuck in the past 
You make mistakes 
You don't prove anything to anyone 
You know what finger ration means 

SUMMARY
- Scientists really think that so-called cat-people are smarter than those who prefer dogs. It has been proved in a US study. 
- Intelligent people adapt to the changing environment easier than less intelligent. They either change their opinions or the environment itself. 
- Smart people are believed to understand other people‚Äôs intentions, motivation, and wishes much better. Think about the smartest friend you have ‚Äî is it easy to get him or her to do something that you want? 
- Of course, intelligent people have partners ‚Äî they love being together with other people. However, they don‚Äôt let their entire lives revolve around their boyfriends or girlfriends. Smart people can live just okay on their own. 
- Intelligent people are messier than less intelligent ones. Scientists think that this is because a person‚Äôs mind is busy with more important things. Smart people know that paying too much attention to such insignificant things is stupid.
- Smart people don‚Äôt lie to themselves just because they can‚Äôt do that. They are unable to convince themselves of something that they know is not true. 
- Intelligent people don‚Äôt like showing their true emotions because they can be used against them. In an argument, it‚Äôs much better to conceal what you really feel, this way you will have a winning position. 
- Smart people use their time wisely. That‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt rely on improvisation. They analyze the situation and evaluate all possible options. 
- Research that was conducted by a team of scientists from Florida Gulf Coast University suggests that lazing around might be a sign of high intelligence. 
- Intelligent people value their experience and memories, but they realize that there is no point getting fixated on what has been said and done. They dream and plan their future while living in the present moment. 
- You can never move on if you keep regretting the mistakes you‚Äôve done in the past. The best thing you do about the mistakes is learning from them and avoid repeating them. 
- Intelligent people don‚Äôt push their smartness on anyone. They know that it doesn‚Äôt matter if anyone knows they are smart or not. 
- There might be a connection between the index finger and the ring finger ration and your mental abilities. Knowing what ration even means already makes you smarter that many people, but still: the ration between the index finger and the ring finger can be calculated by dividing their lengths.

1084,Jm-upHSP9KU,Oingo Boingo - Weird Science,"1985) For most of the 80's Oingo Boingo was to L.A. and Orange County what the Grateful Dead was to San Francisco. Oingo Boingo developed the kind of fan following that made every appearance an event. They were ""our band"", and we believed they knew and appreciated our enthusiasm. 
If you must compare them to any other groups, I think Madness would come close; Not so much for musical styling as for their composition. Both groups were mini-orchestras, and to see them on stage was to behold brilliant chaos. 
Musically, they were one of a kind. Sonically bright and cheerful, lyrically questioning and slightly morbid, they were at the forefront of what became known as New Wave.
To those who are not familiar with their songs, they can be intimidating and strange (think Sparks, if you're familiar with them). 
Their most accessible songs are Dead Man's Party, Weird Science and I Love Little Girls: listen to these a couple of times and the rest of their catalog will come easier.

So today, we‚Äôre going to take a look at computing‚Äôs origins, because even though our digital computers are relatively new, the need for computation is not. Since the start of civilization itself, humans have had an increasing need for special devices to help manage laborious tasks, and as the scale of society continued to grow, these computational devices began to play a crucial role in amplifying our mental abilities. From the abacus and astrolabe to the difference engine and tabulating machine, we‚Äôve come a long way to satisfying this increasing need, and in the process completely transformed commerce, government, and daily life.

Lyrics:

[Morgan Freeman]
So, what are we really made of?
Dig deep inside the atom
and you'll find tiny particles
Held together by invisible forces

Everything is made up
Of tiny packets of energy
Born in cosmic furnaces

[Frank Close]
The atoms that we're made of have
Negatively charged electrons
Whirling around a big bulky nucleus

[Michio Kaku]
The Quantum Theory
Offers a very different explanation
Of our world

[Brian Cox]
The universe is made of 
Twelve particles of matter
Four forces of nature

That's a wonderful and significant story

[Richard Feynman]
Suppose that little things
Behaved very differently
Than anything big

Nothing's really as it seems
It's so wonderfully different
Than anything big

The world is a dynamic mess
Of jiggling things
It's hard to believe

[Kaku]
The quantum theory
Is so strange and bizarre
Even Einstein couldn't get his head around it

[Cox]
In the quantum world
The world of particles
Nothing is certain
It's a world of probabilities

(refrain)

[Feynman]
It's very hard to imagine
All the crazy things
That things really are like

Electrons act like waves
No they don't exactly
They act like particles
No they don't exactly

[Stephen Hawking]
We need a theory of everything
Which is still just beyond our grasp
We need a theory of everything, perhaps
The ultimate triumph of science

1101,IfwbEvX,The Science Of Yogic Breathing | Sundar Balasubramanian | TEDxCharleston,"Rather than examining what takes your breath away, Sundar Balasubramanian, a radiation oncology researcher studies what breath gives you. A deep breath relaxes, and he explains it creates significant beneficial changes in physiologically relevant biomarkers. From his translation and application of one of the more than 3,000 poems in the ancient script Thirumanthiram, Dr. Balasubramanian, has made an important discovery for public health and offers a simple 1-2-3 exercise for well-being.

Born in Tamil Nadu India, Sundar Balasubramanian studied yoga starting at a young age from his father and uncles. Graduating from Gurukula, he majored in chemistry, and yoga, meditation, prayer and group singing also part of the curriculum. In 1999, Dr. Balasubramanian came to Charleston, SC for post-doctoral research. Except for three years working at Yale, Charleston has been home since. His work with other Medical University of South Carolina scientists includes a Yoga adjunct for various diseases. Based on Dr. Balasubramanian's interest in Tamil literature and Yoga, he collects ancient scripts. Applying the translation of one of Thirumoolar's writings to his yoga breathing practice launched the idea for his groundbreaking study of yoga stimulated salivary biochemicals and how they affect human health. His future goal is establish to conduct research on mind-body exercise, from various cultures, to learn any social and therapeutic potential for integrative medicine..

Video transcript:
[festive holiday music]
Announcer: From John Hopkins University

My name is Ibrahima Bah.

Christmas Carol--

(laughs)
growing up.
Scrooge: Who or what are you?
I am the ghost of Christmas past.
Bah: You have Scrooge.
I am the ghost of Christmas present.
Bah: He appears to be moving back and forth in time.
Scrooge: Am I in the presence of the ghost of Christmas yet to come?
Bah: You should wonder how that happened. 
How should that happen?
[dramatic music]
Going forward in time is physically possible.
It uses a trick in special relativity that the clock that you measure is relative to your frame. 
All you have to do is move at incredibly high speeds
then you can go forward in time
and meet people in the future.
Going backwards in time is the one that is hard.
And in order to go backwards in time
either you have to figure out how to make a loop in space-time
or you can make what's called a naked ring singularity in space-time.
Graphic: Naked ring singularity- a location in space-time where the gravitational field of a celestial body becomes infinite
Then going through the ring and around you can go back in time.
[dramatic music continues]
Graphic: Unfortunately for Scrooge, most physicists think any method of traveling backwards in time just isn't possible in the real world.
Bah! 
Humbug.

Check out my blog ‚ñ∫ http://davidsbeenhere.com/ 

In March of 2019, I took one of my favorite trips of all time when I traveled to northeast India and spent two weeks exploring the states of Assam and Meghalaya. What I found there blew my mind. The people, culture, and food were so different from what I was used to in India. My time there really broadened my mind about what India is. I hope you enjoy watching these videos as much as I enjoyed making them.

Follow Rishi on Instagram: www.instagram.com/collosal_appetite

After arriving in Jorhat the previous evening and going on a nighttime street food tour, I linked back up with my boy Rishi the next morning to go on a phenomenal Indian breakfast street food tour. I was hungry, so I couldn‚Äôt wait to eat some amazing street food!

We kicked off our tour at a small, cozy spot called Laxmi. There, Rishi and I got some puri and sabji that contains chickpeas and potatoes. The puris are nice, crispy, and flaky and the sabji is so flavorful and has nice chunks of potato in it. I added some spicy chili chutney to give it a nice kick. I also got some chai, which I let sit for several minutes to let it cool off. It was super frothy and creamy but needed to sit for a little longer.

I love to make mini tacos with the puri and sabji. They‚Äôre so good together. The dish comes with three puris, so you get more than enough to finish off your sabji, but you can always get more. Everything was so good that I got a second helping of all of it, including the chai! Our total came to 70 rupees (or just over $1 U.S.) for both of us together. What a deal!

From there, we got back on Rishi‚Äôs scooter and headed to a local market. The streets were pretty wild! There were people, cars, and cows everywhere! The shop Rishi took me to didn‚Äôt have a name. There, we got rotis and more sabji. This sabji came with a lot more chickpeas and less potatoes than the first one and was served with a spicy chutney on the side. It also contained greens, which was different.

The chutney was different and not as spicy as the last one. It contained some fruits and veggies and was really nice. It was almost like a salsa! I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of the roti (I actually preferred the puri from the last place) but the sabji was amazing! It only cost 25 rupees, or about $0.36 U.S. 

Before our next food spot, we stopped at a Rajmao Pukhuri, a huge pond in the center of Jorhat. This pond is man-made and was constructed by the Ahoms. There are no turtles or ducks there, but there are fish in its waters!

From the pond, we set off to our next destination. Jorhat was an interesting place. It wasn‚Äôt small, but at the same time, it wasn‚Äôt huge either. My hotel was in the central business district but we were making our way through the suburbs where people live. There were lots of vendors selling fruit and clothes by the side of the road.

We arrived at Crunchy Bites to have some raj kachori. I‚Äôd never had it before. It‚Äôs a big, crunchy kachori that‚Äôs stuffed with potatoes, tomatoes, onions, sev, white sauce, tamarind chutney, and masala. It‚Äôs an amazing-looking chaat and it tastes as good as it looks! It didn‚Äôt contain any spice but had tons of flavors, including something similar to sour cream and the sweetness from the tamarind chutney.

I loved breaking pieces of the kachori into the filling and eating it all together. It was so yummy and filling! It was the best thing I ate that day but I was too full to finish it! The raj kachori only cost 60 rupees, or $0.86 U.S.

Next, we visited an inexpensive central market. You have to cross a bridge to get to it. The market contains six different lanes and lots of tiny stalls, some of them only 5 feet in width. I couldn‚Äôt wait to do some shopping!

There were lots of clothing shops, as well as others selling jewelry, shoes, and backpacks. There was a stall selling spices and mouth fresheners as well as onions and peppers. There were lots of spice shops and others selling flattened rice. There were also tailors. This place is only visited by locals, so it‚Äôs a real, immersive experience!

I hope you enjoyed coming along on my breakfast street food and market tour in Jorhat! If you did, please give it a thumbs up and leave me a comment! And please subscribe to my channel so you don‚Äôt miss any of my upcoming travel/food content!

Check out my blog ‚ñ∫ http://davidsbeenhere.com/ 

One of the things I love the most about travel is that destinations are never just one thing. They‚Äôre multi-layered and diverse. A prime example of that is India, a country I‚Äôve now visited three times. The states of Assam and Meghalaya in northeast India, which I explored in March of 2019, are so different from other parts of the country, from the people to the culture to the landscapes to the food. It‚Äôs so exciting to get more of a sense of what India is and I‚Äôm thrilled to share this gorgeous and unique region with you!

Follow Rishi on Instagram: www.instagram.com/collosal_appetite

My first night in the Assamese city of Jorhat continued as my friend Rishi and I headed out on a nighttime street food tour I will never forget! Jorhat is very close to China, so there are lots of Chinese and even Mongolian influences in the cuisine there. I couldn‚Äôt wait to taste them for myself!

First, we headed to Break Time to get some momos. These momos are steamed first and then fried. A rich and spicy red sauce with pepper and chilies is made and the momos are stir-fried with it. These momos weren‚Äôt too hot and I loved the red sauce! They were the best fried momos I‚Äôd ever had. They were still crunchy on the outside and super juicy in the middle. The chicken inside was minced and perfectly cooked. They‚Äôre super filling and were like spicy, Szechwan-inspired momos. I was in love with them! You get a massive plate of them for only 60 rupees, or roughly $0.86 U.S.

Next, we headed back out and got some Vada Pav at Delhi Chaat House. Vada Pav is a potato fritter that is served on a bun with chutneys and is sometimes referred to as an Indian burger. I‚Äôd had it before in Mumbai and Pune and couldn‚Äôt wait to try it again. It was served with mustard, sweet sauce, coriander chutney, and a spicy sauce. The sweet sauce was so tasty. The bun was super fluffy and the spicy sauce was really hot! I also loved the coriander chutney. It was an amazing potato mash sandwich! It only cost about 40 rupees, or about $0.58 U.S.  

After that, we continued our street food tour by heading back out and getting some spicy chicken wings at Seev‚Äôs. They use the second spiciest peppers in the world, ghost peppers, in their wings. There was a honey glazed sauce on it that contained the peppers. The chicken wasn‚Äôt that hot but was super juicy. The heat made my lips tingle a little bit as I continued eating.

We also got some double-marinated chicken tandoori drumsticks, which had a thick, white sauce on them. I loved the smoky flavor and the glaze was so creamy and cheesy. I was in love with them! I added some mint chutney to them which was great. The sauce was like a soft brie cheese. Our total there came to 450 rupees ($6.49 U.S.): 250 ($3.60 U.S.) for the wings and 200 ($2.88 U.S.) for the tandoori drumsticks.

Next, we were back on the streets of Jorhat to get some spicy pani puri! Pani Puri is my favorite Indian dish of all time and my mouth was all set for a spicy version of it! They‚Äôre made of leavened, hollow flatbread that is filled with an aloo (potato) mixture, chilies, onions, pani (spiced water), and a spicy sauce. It was super hot and really good. I loved the crunch and chunks of potato. I‚Äôd never had pani puri this spicy! It costs 10 rupees ($0.14 U.S.) for 5 puris and the vendor keeps giving you more until you say you‚Äôre done.

The vendor also gave me a dry one without pani that I liked even better! I could honestly eat pani puri forever. The dry ones without the pani were so fantastic! I loved them so much. They were both spicy and sweet and had an incredible flavor combination. And even though it‚Äôs 10 rupees for 5, the vendor actually gives you an extra one for free!

Our final destination was Ice Station, where we got some rose lassi. I hadn‚Äôt had lassi in a while and I wanted to cool my mouth off after the spicy pani puri. It was delicious and milky and more like a shake. They put nuts on top, which add a nice crunch. I‚Äôd had a thicker lassi in Amritsar but I really liked this one, too. It had a nice rose flavor and helped me beat the fiery feeling in my mouth, so it did the trick! 

I hope you loved my nighttime street food tour of Jorhat! If you did, please give it a thumbs up and leave me a comment. Also, please subscribe to my channel.

In this IFTAR Street Food tour of Karachi, Pakistan,We're going street food rangin' for tons of famous Pakistani Street Food in Karachi, mostly all the BEST and most famous Iftar Street food in Karachi, like samosas, gulab jamon, jalebi, extreme street chicken, and also some insanely delicious Pulao!! At first, I thought it was biryani, but it's actually Pulao!! It was full of chickpeas!

Karachi street food is VERY delicious and famous for food lovers! In this street food video, I'm starting out by exploring burns road and finding a famous Chicken chargha, WHOLE chicken coated in masala and spice and deep fried in the richest, darkest oil. I bought a whole chicken and packed it up in a bag and kept exploring the deep back alleys near burns road for more famous Pakistani street food.

After this, I found an alleyway selling thousands and thousands of unique street foods, right off of Burns road in Karachi. I stopped at the first and most busiest stall I saw, selling famous Pakistani pakoras, samosas, jalebi desserts, and more. I ordered a few of the best street foods I saw and tried to pay but no one would accept my payment! 

Then, we're meeting up with my friends Shehroze and Alizeh to break the fast for the Iftar for Ramzan (Ramadan). We found a local restaurant and brought all the food in and purchased some extra street food and started eating!

The next day, Shehroze and Alizeh are bringing us to a very local style place to break the fast with all the locals, right under a bridge! There were HUGE pots of biryani and pulao and everyone was waiting patiently for the food. We helped serve the biryani and pulao and then had a taste for ourselves! It was one of the BEST pulao rice I've ever tasted!

I hope you're enjoying this big Pakistani street food video series! Thanks so much for watching, I would love to hear from you down below!

There is much more street food in our Pakistani food videos series, get ready for the playlist of a lifetime!!

1140,5LYl4DM5c4,Street Food in Malaysia - ULTIMATE MALAYSIAN FOOD in Kuala Lumpur!,"Thanks to Oh My Media: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgmy...
Subscribe http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe for 2 new videos every week
T-shirts and caps: https://goo.gl/6WdK1l

Huge thank you to Fadhlur for reaching out and taking us on a Malaysian street food tour of Kuala Lumpur. It was an amazing day, and I have so much love to Malaysia as it was one of the first countries where I started making street food videos - as you‚Äôll see in the video!

Ok, here are all the street food stalls and restaurants we ate at on this tour:

Mansion Tea Stall
The thing to order here is the roti canai special, roti that chopped up, then doused in a variety of curry sauces, sambal, and a few soft boiled eggs. It‚Äôs a perfect way to begin your day in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 2.80 RM ($0.68) per plate

Nasi Lemak Tanglin
Nasi lemak is often considered the national food of Malaysia, and there are plenty of places to eat it throughout Kuala Lumpur. Having been around since 1948, Nasi Lemak Tanglin is a place I had wanted to go for a while. It was overall very good, with a nice laid back atmosphere and surrounded by nature. Nasi lemak - about 8 RM ($1.94) per plate

Ikan Bakar Seri Melaka (Jalan Bellamy)
One of my favorite places to eat ikan bakar, grilled fish, is on Jalan Bellamy. Back in 2012, I had to hike over a highway and climb a few fences to get there as I was only on foot. In this video, I‚Äôm a bit older, and we had a car! The ikan bakar was just as good as I remember it. Total price - 68 RM ($16.51) for everything

Sri Ganapathi Mess
One of the best things about Malaysian food is its incredible diversity, including Malay, Chinese, and Indian food. Banana leaf south Indian food is very popular and I was recommended to try Sri Ganapathi Mess, a restaurant tucked away into a home. An amazing south Indian food experience in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 59 RM ($14.32) for 4 people

Kedai Kopi Lai Foong
Finally, another dish that many had recommended me was the unique clam noodles in Kuala Lumpur Chinatown at the legendary Kedai Kopi Lai Foong. It was delicious, and a perfect way to end an amazing Malaysian street food tour in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 10 RM ($2.43) per bowl

Again, thank you to Oh My Media Malaysia for taking us around:

We're going Foodrangin' for tons of FAMOUS Pakistan Street Food - including the AMAZING BBQ Nisar Charsi Tikka Kababs, some amazing UNSEEN Pakistani Pulao, and ULTRA RARE PIZZA NAAN!!

You will fall in  love with the street food in Peshawar as soon as you arrive! Today, we're starting out with an UNSEEN Pulao, found in downtown Peshawar in the old area where there is street food everywhere! Here, it was full of basmati rice and huge chunks of beef and huge beef bones with unbelievably delicious bone marrow!

After this, we're going Foodrangin' and finding some local street stalls before going to Nisar Charsi Tikka BBQ Mutton HEAVEN!

First, we found a local Pakistan street food served right on the street, the fruit chaat! It was a delicious fruit salad topped with a rose syrup! This was amazing, but what was even more delicious than this famous food in Pakistan is the Pizza naan we found next!

After tasting  the fruit chaat, we walked down a local alley in Peshawar that was full of delicious Pakistani street food, like mutton kerahi (sometimes called Karhai) and fried street fish!

We found one of the most unique street foods in Pakistan, the Pizza naan! It was loaded with tomato, coriander, potato mash, and sliced potato! It was quite salty and was delicious!

After this, we made our way to Namak Mandi in Peshawar to visit the super famous and ultra unique Nisar Charsi Tikka! But first, we found a home cooked Pakistani street food, the Saag! Here, it was served with lassi and also Pakistani corn bread! It was so unique!

And for our final meal, we went to the WORLD FAMOUS Nisar Charsi Tikka! Here, we met the LEGEND himself, Mr. Nisar Charsi! Here, you can get huge BBQ kababs and also delicious Mutton Kerahi! It was  so amazing to taste!!!

1150,rOAbYFdNQE,"The Ultimate DUBAI FOOD TOUR - Street Food and Emirati Cuisine in Dubai, UAE!","Check out this amazing food in Dubai, UAE!
Peyman‚Äôs Channel‚ñ∫ https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu2S...
Subscribe for 2 new videos per week‚ñ∫ 

When I was in Dubai, I had the privilege of hanging out and eating with my friend Peyman (). He‚Äôs from Dubai, he loves to eat, and he knows some of the best food spots in Dubai. So in this Dubai food tour, we went around and ate Emirati food, rice and lamb, street food, karak tea, and finally ended with home cooked Emirati food at Peyman‚Äôs home.

One thing I want to quickly mention, and Peyman and I discussed this in the video as well, is that Emirati food at restaurants is still not very common in Dubai. This is because there are so many international restaurants in Dubai, and local Emiratis typically just eat their food at home. But things are changing and there is starting to be a higher demand for Emirati food in Dubai.

Al Fanar Restaurant - One of the only full Emirati food restaurants in Dubai. We ordered Luqaimat, Tharid, Madrooba, Balaleet. All the food was fantastic, and it‚Äôs a nice environment.
Total price - 280 AED ($76.21)

Karak - 0.50 AED ($0.14) per cup - This is originally adapted from India, but it‚Äôs a full part of the culture in UAE, and you can get cups of karak tea right to your car.

Al Marhabani Restaurant - Mandi is one of the greatest Arabian food dishes, originally from Yemen. It includes rice and meat that‚Äôs traditionally cooked in an underground oven. The lamb here was outstanding.
Total price - 200 AED ($54.44)

Al Labeeb Grocery - Regag bread - This is a little gem of a shop that Peyman took me to. They make some Dubai street food style crepes with cheese and fish sauce, and it‚Äôs awesome.
Price - 6 AED ($1.63) each

Machboos - Finally at Peyman‚Äôs house for dinner, he cooked machboos, one of the national dishes of UAE. It was a great way to end this Dubai food tour!

Thank you for watching this Dubai food tour!

We had one full day in Zurich, Switzerland, and I wanted to make the most of it by going on a Swiss food tour, eating as much food as possible, and walking around and seeing some of the most famou sights and attractions in the beautiful city of Zurich.

Here are all the details about everything you‚Äôll find in this video:

Z√ºrich, Switzerland

Caf√© Henrici - To begin the day for Swiss breakfast, we stopped to have a cup of coffee, and also I wanted a croissant, but they were all out of the morning already, so I settled for a few small slices of bread. It was excellent.
Total price for 3 people - 24.40 CHF ($25.75)

Lindenhof Hill - This is a great place to get a view over Old Zurich, and it puts the city into perspective and helps you get your bearings, and the views are beautiful.

Swiss Chuchi - Thank you to Marcel for this recommendation. In Switzerland for a single day, I needed to eat one of the most well known of all Swiss food, cheese fondue. At Swiss Chuchi restaurant, we enjoyed both cheese fondue and raclette, both of which were excellent and the most cheese I‚Äôve had in a  single meal in a very long time.
Total price - 126 CHF ($132.98)
That included all I ate, and 2 other plates  of food.

Grossm√ºnster - This church is one of the most recognizable landmarks of Zurich. For a small fee, you can pay to climb to the top of the tower for an amazing view.
Price -  4 CHF ($4.22)

Lake Zurich - The city of Zurich is surrounds Lake Zurich, which is unbelievably clean and pure.

Kronenhalle Restaurant  - This is one of the most legendary and classic restaurants in all of Zurich, Switzerland. I didn‚Äôt realized it was so expensive and so high end, but we decided to go for it anyway, because I was looking forward to trying their Z√ºrcher Geschnetzeltes, the most well known of all Zurich Swiss food dishes consisting of thin sliced potato paired with veal stew. It‚Äôs quite a stunning dish and the version at Kronenhalle Restaurant was absolutely stunning.
Total price - 126 CHF ($132.98)

Bahnhofstrasse Shopping street 

Rheinfelder Bierhalle - To finish off this ultimate Swiss food tour of Zurich in a single day we went to Rheinfelder Bierhalle, a beer hall and restaurant in Zurich. I ordered their specialty, Jumbo Jumbo Cordon Bleu. Cordon bleu is another one of the Swiss food dishes you don‚Äôt want  to miss when you‚Äôre in Zurich.

Thank you very much for watching this  Swiss food tour!

1164,D59Ld3KKM6M,LONDON STREET FOOD,"LONDON STREET FOOD, Southbank Centre‚Äôs food market offers fantastic street food, a great range of beers, wines and cocktails, delicious coffee, tea and sweet treats ‚Äì with a selection of fresh produce to take home, and guest traders each week. All our stallholders are committed to providing food that bursts with fresh, vibrant flavours, inspired by cuisines from Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas. No wonder SCFood Market is one of London‚Äôs top food destinations.

You can find the market on Southbank Centre Square each weekend including bank holidays and for an extended market at the end of summer.

What‚Äôs to eat?
Perfectly grilled corn-on-the-cob, the best moong dal dosas in town, Korean burritos, vegan Ethiopian, craft beers, interesting cocktails, cake, ice cream, great coffee... in other words, LOADS!  Bread Tree make bruschetta the way families in Italy have done for centuries, no short cuts. They use bread made in a small bakery in Sicily, and offer vegan and wheat-free options too! Seasonings and toppings are all sourced in Calabria, such as pickled aubergines, sundried tomatoes, pesto Calabrese, sundried tomato paste and nduja.

Also on the menu are piadina, the delicious Italian flatbread sandwich. Go for the traditional parma ham or check out one of the veggie or vegan options, all served with sauces that come from southern Italy.

Cristian‚Äôs family is originally from Calabria, where his grandfather was a producer of wine and olive oil. Rebecca, originally from Taiwan, also comes from a country where people are very passionate about great food, and she has contributed to Bread Tree her dedication to healthy ingredients.  Tea, Bread & Brownie brings a wide selection of teas, real Belgian hot chocolate and chai latte to serve at the market, as well as retail teas to take home and brew.

Also check out their range of Flour Station sourdough breads, pastries and sweet and savoury treats including cheese straws, savoury muffins, brownies, cream teas, and more, all of which have been freshly baked.

As well as buying teas to take home, you can enjoy a hot cup of tea to go. If the weather‚Äôs hot, why not try their range of ice teas and iced chai latte all summer.  The Polish Deli London offers a wide range of delicious and authentic Polish food. Sample traditionally madepork smoked sausages served with salad and pickles in a baguette, or with roasted baby potatoes, cured meats, Polish draught beer and, in winter, sauerkraut stew, made with smoked pork sausage.  When Will and Kerry hand you your gourmet burger, you‚Äôre getting it from the hands of the same people who raised the cows and grew the wheat and grass they feasted on. The beef is hung on the bone for three weeks, then they seam cut the beef (a continental style of butchery which cuts around the muscles rather than slicing straight through them). They bind the burgers with their own free range eggs. 

And if that is not enough for you, pop a couple of their steaks in your bag to take home.",Food

1166,OyxWVJQUC18,World Famous Hyderabadi CHICKEN BIRYANI | Biryani MAKING & Tasting,"The Hyderabadi Biryani needs no detailed introduction. This glorious delicacy is a staple for the locals and the go-to dish for the tourists. Hyderabadi Biryani is characteristically distinct from its popular counterparts because of its distinct aroma, taste, texture and the mode of preparation.

With the essence of Turkish, Mughlai and Arabic influences in it, the Hyderabadi Biryani has been an integral part of the Hyderabad‚Äôs culinary tradition since a long time. In this culinary exploration, we have set out to savour the dazzling aura of this majestic dish at some of the most famed destinations across the city. We are happy to be accompanied by our gracious host Sankalp Vishnu who is an acclaimed food critic and food expert.

We tried Hyderabadi biryani at two eminent places-The Lucky restaurant and the Bawarchi restaurant. Our intention was to understand the nuances or fine tuning of the variations in the Hyderabadi biryani as adopted by these joints. 

Our first stop was the Lucky restaurant that serves one of the best versions of the Kachi Gost Ki Biryani. We got the opportunity to witness the making of a batch of Hyderabadi Biryani at their wonderful, aromatic kitchen. The seemingly easy procedure entails an astute understanding of the dynamics of its cooking, perseverance and dexterity. The genial owner for Lucky restaurant walked us through the process sharing all the details of their prized preparation. We then tried the Nalli Biryani along with some other delectable meaty wonders. The feast ended with the lusciously amazing Khubani ka Meetha a dessert that‚Äôs exclusive to the city.

The next day we went to the acclaimed Bawarchi restaurant to try their version of the Hyderabadi Biryani. In recent years it has emerged as favourite destination for the same. The beautifully done Chicken Biryani was worth all the reputation. It ticked all the boxes of parameters that make the magic of a biryani work. A distinct feature of the biryani here was the pleasantly notable presence of the shah jeera flavour in it. Here we also tried the Hyderabad famous Double Ka Meetha and the Kaddu ka kheer. The latter one was the best.
 
While winding up this Hyderabadi biryani trail we couldn‚Äôt but wonder at the flamboyant stature of this apparently royal dish that rules the heart of the masses in and beyond this city.

 We are truly grateful to Sankalp Vishnu for his cooperation.

Street Food in Brazil - Rio de Janeiro!    

Ever since I first learned about the city of Rio de Janeiro when I was a kid growing up, I have wanted to visit. Finally, the time has come. In this Brazilian street food tour in Rio de Janeiro, we‚Äôll go to eat some of the best street food snacks and dishes, some hole in the wall style Brazilian food restaurants, and also visit some of the most unbelievable and gorgeous sights and attractions in Rio de Janeiro. It‚Äôs one of the most beautiful cities I‚Äôve ever visited.

Here‚Äôs the Brazilian food and things we did:

Mineiro, Sausage Sandwich - 5 BRL ($1.26) - For Brazilian breakfast we headed to Mineiro for his neighborhood grilled sausage sandwich, topped with his house made aioli dressing, cheese, and lettuce, and his own home-made chili sauce. He‚Äôs not only an amazing guy, but his sausage sandwich is outstanding. When you‚Äôre in Rio de Janeiro, you don‚Äôt want to miss it. Located just outside Siqueira Campos MRT Metro station (Map: ), sets up in the morning about 7 am.

Trem do Corcovado - 65 BRL ($16.44) - Christ the Redeemer - I pre-bought tickets online for the tram, so when we arrived we just picked up and printed the tickets. The tram took about 20 minutes and Christ The Redeemer at the top was breathtaking.

Selaron Steps - Another attraction in Rio de Janeiro that I wasn‚Äôt going to miss was the Selaron Steps, created by Chilean artist Selaron. They are so cool and so iconic.

Lunch at Bar Rex - For some seriously meaty Brazilian food, Bar Rex is the spot. They serve an major selection of drinks, but they also specialize in food like roasted chicken, sausages, and the oxtail. The food was outstanding, and the owners are just so cool. Location: 

Ipanema Beach - World famous, one of the most well known beaches in the world, and for a good reason - the scenery is spectacular. We had a tea with Marcelo (5 BRL ($1.26) and then tried some of the Brazilian local favorite comfort Biscoito Globo cassava snacks. Finally, another iconic Brazilian drink is the caipirinha (15 BRL ($3.79) made on the beach.

Copacabana Beach - Next up on this Brazilian street food and attractions tour we stopped at the famous Copacabana Beach and had a coconut (6.50 BRL ($1.64) and continued on the Red Beach in Urca to get a good view of Sugarloaf Mountain (P√£o de A√ß√∫car).

Bar Urca - Also in Urca, you‚Äôll find Bar Urca, an old food and bar establishment that‚Äôs famous for serving empada de camar√£o (6.50 BRL ($1.64), shrimp filled pastries. Many people order and then sit on the edge of the water in the evening. Location: 

Bar Gato de Botas - A Brazilian boteco is a bar and restaurant that serves small plates of food similar to tapas. The owner of Bar Gato de Botas is a legend and his plates of Brazilian food are delicious. Location: 

Brazilian meat kebabs - Finally to end this incredible street food tour of Rio de Janeiro, we returned back to the same spot where we had breakfast, but in the evening, a different yet equally friendly man sets up selling Brazilian meat kebas and home cooked Brazilian food. When you order a kebab, you can get it stopped with cassava powder and drenched in hot sauce - it was so good. Location:  Sets up in the evening about 6 pm.

Rio de Janeiro is a beautiful city and this Brazilian street food tour and attraction in Rio was amazing - the food, the people, the scenery.

ü•íABOUT BEFRS:
Hey, I‚Äôm Sonny! I‚Äôm from the US but currently call Vietnam home. I‚Äôve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. People either enjoyed my undeniable charm or enjoyed watching me eat things like coconut worms, and thus Best Ever Food Review Show came to be.

I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer. If you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture.

Don‚Äôt forget to subscribe to Best Ever Food Review Show, so we can connect through food and travel and become Bestys!

During the fourteenth century the Renaissance started in Italy, and slowly spread throughout Europe. As shown in this episode, the refreshing Renaissance era indicates an intellectual, philosophical, artistic and religious revolution and is mainly influenced by humanism. The objective of this movement to improve humanity also had its effect on the kitchen and dinner table. Strict table manners and consumption of imported vegetables are examples of the many culinary changes discussed in the episode.

Guilherme (Rio4Fun): 
Subscribe  for 2 new videos every week
T-shirts and caps: 

Goi√¢nia, Goi√°s, Brazil - From Curitiba we continued our food trip in Brazil to Goi√¢nia in the state of Goi√°s, Brazil. It was a day of unique fruits, most specifically the pequi fruit, unlike any other natural unprocessed food I‚Äôve ever tried in my life.   

Mercado Central de Goi√¢nia - We began at the central market, where we walked around first, before trying a number of empad√£o, one of the main snacks to eat - a little dough pie filled with a variety of ingredients. It was delicious and hearty, especially when topped with some of the house made hot sauce. Price - 32 BRL ($7.93) for all

Exotic fruit - There was a jungle exotic Brazilian fruit shop where we sampled a few fruits like jatoba, before continued on this Brazilian food tour.

CIDADE DE GOI√ÅS - The main goal of the day was to drive to the historical city of Goi√°s, about 2 hours from Goi√¢nia. The drive was beautiful and it was nice to see some of the countryside.

Restaurante Braseiro - But by far the highlight of the day was eating at Restaurante Braseiro, an extremely friendly and traditional Brazilian food restaurant. When we arrived I could already sense the love coming from the restaurant, and I loved the way they cooked the food, all over fire in the kitchen buffet style. The day we arrived they hadn‚Äôt cooked pequi fruit, but when we arrived and said was had come specifically to eat it, they cooked it for us. Pequi is a very unique and slightly bizarre fruit from this region of Brazil. It can be dangerous because of the spikes in the center - so don‚Äôt bite too deep. But the flavor is unlike any other fruit I‚Äôve ever had, almost like cheddar cheese. Price - 20 BRL ($4.95) per person

Banca da Pamonha - When we got back to the city, we continued with a few Brazilian street food snacks, including pamonha, which is the local version of a tamale. I was impressed how good they were. Price - 26 BRL ($6.44) for 3

Boteco do Z√© do Ab√≠lio - Finally to end this Brazilian food tour, we went to Boteco do Z√© do Ab√≠lio to have some serious meat. Total price - 118 BRL ($29.23)

It was an amazing day in Brazil, and especially a regional Brazilian food learning experience.

Chinese Street Food Shanghai - Chinese Street Food - Street Food China
Chinese street food and Chinese Food in China is incredibly delicious! So I flew to Shanghai, China and have been eating street food, noodles, and dumplings non-stop. Best Street Food to try! The Chinese food is so good in Shanghai! I've eaten street food in Bejing, street food in Chengdu, street food in Xi‚Äôan, street food in Guangzhou, and now, street food in Shanghai. A lot of the street food in Shanghai is similar to other street food in China. You can find some unique Shanghai street food specialties here, like xiaolongbao (soup dumplings), shengjianbao (pan fried dumplings), seafood on the street, and some delicious noodles as well. You can also enjoy countless other street foods in Shanghai, many featured in this video.

Grilled Onion Blossom
RECIPE COURTESY OF KATIE LEE
Level: Easy
Total: 55 min
Active: 10 min
Yield: 4 servings

Ingredients

Dipping Sauce:
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon prepared hot horseradish 
1 teaspoon store-bought BBQ seasoning 
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 
Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 

Onion Blossom:
Olive oil cooking spray, for the pie plate and onion
1 large Vidalia onion 
1 tablespoon store-bought BBQ seasoning 

Directions

For the dipping sauce: Combine the mayonnaise, horseradish, BBQ seasoning, mustard and some salt and pepper in a small mixing bowl. Store refrigerated in an airtight container until ready to serve.
For the onion blossom: Preheat a grill to 350 degrees F. Spay a disposable pie plate with olive oil cooking spray.

Peel the onion and trim the root end to remove any hairs. Slice the pointy stem end of the onion off. Turn the onion so the root end is facing up. Leaving a 1/2-inch rim around the root, make 4 cuts into the onion, down to the stem end. This results in 4 sections of the onion. Repeating the same motion, make 3 more cuts into each section of the onion, from root to stem end. Turn the onion over to reveal 16 onion petals. Use your hands to separate the layers of petals as needed.

Place the onion stem-side up in the prepared pie plate. Generously spray all of the petals with the olive oil cooking spray. Sprinkle the onion with the BBQ seasoning.

Put the onion on the grill and close the grill. Roast at 350 degrees F, checking halfway, until the onion blossom has opened, 40 to 45 minutes. The petals should be tender and darkened on the ends. 

Carefully remove the onion from the grill. Serve warm with the dipping sauce.

There are few cities in the world that can compare to Jerusalem in terms of ancient history and religious significance. It‚Äôs one of the most fascinating cities in the world, and it‚Äôs a city that I‚Äôve wanted to visit my entire life. Finally, along with my friend David () and Rafram, we explored Jerusalem to discover the food treasures the city has to offer - and let me tell you, you‚Äôll find some incredibly delicious food in Jerusalem!
 
We started off the Jerusalem food tour by first walking around East Jerusalem and starting with the best plate of hummus I‚Äôve ever had. We then toured around Old Jerusalem, and enjoyed some incredible Palestinian food kebabs cooked by an incredible man who cooked with serious love and passion. Another highlight in Jerusalem was the mutabak, a thin  pastry stuffed with cheese and baked.

After eating our way through Old Jerusalem, we then headed into West Jerusalem and went to lunch at an Israeli Jewish restaurant serving a mix of amazing dishes. The food was home-cooked in style, and absolutely sensation. A few more snacks and sightseeing throughout the afternoon, and that brought us all the way to dinner where David had made reservations to eat at one of the hottest restaurants in Jerusalem, Machneyuda Restaurant. It was quite an experience, and an amazing meal and lively atmosphere to wrap up this ultimate Jerusalem food tour.

Here‚Äôs all the food and places included in this Palestinian food and Israeli food tour of Jerusalem:

Hummus Acramawi
Price - 20 ILS ($5.57) per plate

Almond juice - 3.90 ILS ($1.09)

Al-shuala Grill Restaurant
Shawarma - 26 ILS ($7.26)

Al Baghdadi Kabab
Palestinian kebabs
Total price - 100 ILS ($27.89)

Zalatimo Sweets
Mutabak
Price - 30 ILS ($8.37) each

Peaches - 10 for 1 kg
Plums - 10 for 1 kg
Fruit - 10 ILS ($2.76) per kg.

Mahane Yehuda Market
Azura Restaurant
Total price - 400 ILS ($111.55)

Western Wall (Wailing Wall)
Western Wall Tunnel
Price - 35 ILS ($9.76) per person

Dome of the Rock

Mount of Olives

Machneyuda Restaurant
Total price - 700 ILS ($195.21)

It was a lot of food in a single day, but it was one of the greatest food and learning days that I‚Äôve ever had in my life. The generosity of the people we connected with, paired with the food, was truly a memorable experience in Jerusalem.

Thank you again to David () and Rafram for showing me some of the best food in Jerusalem!

Petchaburi Soi 5 (‡πÄ‡∏û‡∏ä‡∏£‡∏ö‡∏∏‡∏£‡∏µ ‡∏ã‡∏≠‡∏¢ 5) has long been one of my go-to street food streets in Bangkok. Starting in the evening at around 4 pm, the entire road starts to fill with street food carts selling all sorts of Thai dishes. You‚Äôll find everything from rice and curry to soup noodles, snacks, and fresh fruits and vegetables. It had been a few years since I had explore Petchaburi Soi 5 (‡πÄ‡∏û‡∏ä‡∏£‡∏ö‡∏∏‡∏£‡∏µ ‡∏ã‡∏≠‡∏¢ 5), so in this Thai street food tour I‚Äôm taking you with me to some of my old favorites, and some new spots. Enjoy!

Yam mama (‡∏¢‡∏≥‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏°‡πà‡∏≤) - 50 THB ($1.52) - This is the first dish I tried. MAMA are Thai instant noodles and this is a completely different way to eat them - in mixed salad form.

Khanom krok (‡∏Ç‡∏ô‡∏°‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏Å) - 30 THB ($0.92) - Coconut griddle cakes are one of my favorites, they are crunchy on the outside and gooey in the center. Don‚Äôt miss this Thai street food snack.

Cha yen (‡∏ä‡∏≤‡πÄ‡∏¢‡πá‡∏ô) - 25 THB ($0.76) per cup - Thai tea

Pad thai (‡∏ú‡∏±‡∏î‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢), Hoy tod (‡∏´‡∏≠‡∏¢‡∏ó‡∏≠‡∏î) - This was formerly a street food cart that now has their own permanent shophouse location. They make pretty decent Pad Thai and they hoy tod, which in this case in a mussels omelet, is pretty good as well.
Total price - 125 THB ($3.81)

Nam prik pla too (‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡∏û‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏Å‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏ó‡∏π) - For something a little healthier, I‚Äôm a huge fan of nam pirk pla too, a pounded chili mackerel sauce that‚Äôs eaten with vegetables.
Total price - 70 THB ($2.14) for everything

Chao guay (‡πÄ‡∏â‡∏≤‡∏Å‡πã‡∏ß‡∏¢) - 25 THB ($0.76) - For dessert, I had grass jelly with ice. The owner was so friendly and happy.

Haircut - 100 THB ($3.05)

Pad kra prao moo krob kai dao (‡∏ú‡∏±‡∏î‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏û‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏´‡∏°‡∏π‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏≠‡∏ö‡πÑ‡∏Ç‡πà‡∏î‡∏≤‡∏ß) - Final meal of this Bangkok street food tour, I headed across the street to Petchaburi Soi 10 to seek out one of my old time favorites. The stall was still there, and they make a pretty good plate of Thai crispy pork belly fried with basil.
Price - 40 THB ($1.22)

Thank you for joining me on this Thai street food tour of Petchaburi Soi 5 (‡πÄ‡∏û‡∏ä‡∏£‡∏ö‡∏∏‡∏£‡∏µ ‡∏ã‡∏≠‡∏¢ 5). It‚Äôs the type of street you can walk through and just choose whatever you like to eat.

Chinese Street Food Islam - Muslim Chinese Street Food - Street Food China
I made my way to Lanzhou, in search of the best Chinese street food and halal Chinese muslim food. I found a ton of street food and specialty halal snacks. Lanzhou is in the northwest of China, close to the far west Xinjiang province, and is home of the Hui people, and the food is fantastic! There was a lot of Chinese street food and Islam muslim Chinese cuisine. Just like you, I love street food around the world, and I travel for food. I came here to eat!

Street food in China is something I'm always looking to find more of! So I flew to Lanzhou, China and have been trying Chinese Muslim Hui Halal Street food non stop. Best Street Food in China I've tasted! The Chinese food is so good in Lanzhou! I've eaten street food in Bejing, street food in Shanghai, street food in Chengdu, and street food in Hong Kong, all of which has been amazing, but I have to say that the chinese street food in Lanzhou has been some of the best! 

When you think of China, you probably don't think of Islam and Halal food, but that's exactly what you'll find in the Northwest. I made my way for a  food trip to the dusty and bustling classic Silk Road city of Lanzhou specifically to try the unique halal food of the Hui people. This is the side of China not many people see, and I came here to have an authentic travel experience through food.  I found a lot of food reminiscent of countries further west, with insane amounts of lamb and beef leaving me absolutely speechless. 

Here are the addresses for the places I ate Chinese Hui Muslim Halal Street Food of in Lanzhou, China. You can show a taxi driver these addresses and he will bring you there:

‚ñ∫T-shirts and caps available now: 
‚ñ∫Check out my Nairobi travel guide: 

Thank you for watching this ultimate Kenyan street food tour in Nairobi! I met up with my friend James who took me around to a few of his favorite spots to eat.

Kawangware, Nairobi, Kenya

Here's most of the food we tried on this amazing tour of Nairobi:

Ann Restaurant - Dagoretti Corner - This small street food stall on Dagoretti Corner in Nairobi serves all sorts of Kenyan / East African foods. Their chapatis are especially good, and their Lake Victoria  sardines fried with tomatoes.
Chapati
Dagaa - Lake Victoria sardine
Matumbo - stomach stew
Githeri - beans and maize
The guy sitting across the table - ‚Äúyou should not eat beans and sardines together, or you‚Äôll have gas.‚Äù
Total bill - 1,050 KES ($10.39) - we paid for 4 or 5 guys eating there

Stomach Clinix -  This was  the best  food stop of the day, a neighborhood meat shop that James took me to that specializes in cow head soup. The grilled tongue was also spectacular, but the soup was the best.
Total price - 200 KES ($1.98)

Dagoretti Market -  After the meat, we took a walk over to Dagoretti Market. After browsing around for a while, we stopped for another plate of mixed Kenyan food, mostly dengu, which are mung beans. It was simple, but quite good.
Dengu - mung beans
Total price - 300 KES ($2.97)

Unity Cafe Hotel - We met up with some of James' friend in Kawangware, and went to eat across the street from their shoe shop. The mandazi mix was the highlight of this Kenyan meal.
Total price - 600 KES ($5.94) for all

Cow foot fry - Next we headed over to Oscar who makes cow food soup, fry and boil. He was a very friendly man, and showed me his entire process of making cow foot soup. It was delicious!
Total price - 450 KES ($4.45)

Kenyan street food - To end this Kenyan street food tour of Nairobi we had to eat one of the ultimate Kenyan fast food meat treats. You'll see these types of grills all over the streets in the late afternoon throughout Nairobi. You just choose what you want, it's cut on the chopping board, and you stand and eat.
Esophagus
Intestines
Mutura - minced meat sausage
Mutura - blood sausage
Udder
Total price - 200 KES ($1.97)

Thank you for watching this ultimate Nairobi street food tour!

Thanks to Frank and Jerry of Zouba Tours:  for taking me around. I paid for this tour, but they did a great job and I would recommend them.

Kunming, Yunnan, China - Kunming is the capital and largest city in Yunnan province China. So I was excited to explore the local market in Kunming and eat as much street food as possible!

Here are all the Chinese street food dishes we ate throughout the market:

Rice pudding - 5 RMB ($0.76) - This was slightly fermented, and sweet, like a rice alcohol pudding. It was pretty good, but quite sweet, so I couldn‚Äôt eat that much of it.

Dumpling - 1 RMB ($0.15) - I saw these dumplings sizzling and hissing and there was no way I could walk by without trying one. Stuffed inside were leek and egg. They were a little on the oily side, but delicious.

Whole duck - 20 RMB ($3.03) - Yunnan is famous for roast duck, and there‚Äôs a version that‚Äôs comparable even to Beijing style. Style I was excited to find a stall that at the market that specialize in Yunnanese roast duck. It was delicious and the owners were very friendly as well.

Pickled pears - 5 RMB ($0.76) - This was an interesting snack, and supposed to be very healthy and good for digestion. 

Drink - 2 RMB ($0.30) - This drink was incredible sweet, but refreshing.

Tofu Noodles - 5.5 RMB ($0.83) - Another extremely popular Chinese street food snack at the market was tofu noodles - I‚Äôve had tofu and noodles, but not really mixed before. It was a little plain and starchy, but from all the sauces, it was taty.
Rice balls - 5 RMB ($0.76) - We also tried sesame rice balls which were delicious.

Jacuzzi braised ¬Ω chicken - 15 RMB ($2.27) - This was one of the highlights of the market for me, mainly because the owner was so friendly and his giant jacuzzi of boiling chickens was amazing to see! The chicken was a little bony, but flavorful.

Yellow soybean porridge - 3.5 RMB ($0.53) - As we were leaving the market, we stopped for one last bowl of soybean porridge to eat with youtiau, Chinese donuts. I wasn‚Äôt expecting to like it as much as I did, but it was delicious. It was very warming and hearty.

Finally to complete this Chinese street food tour in Kunming, Jerry and I, along with his family ate Chinese Yunnanese bbq. It was tasty and a great way to end this amazing day of street food.

Special thanks to Zouba Tours () for arranging everything in this video. I paid for this tour, but I think they did a great job, and I thoroughly enjoyed the food and the tour.

That completes Day 4 of this Chinese food tour of Yunnan. If you haven‚Äôt already, watch the full series here:

Thank you to B. Hamzaev - Head of Marketing and Promotion of Uzbekistan Tourism. Check out Bekruz: 

Ravshan‚Äôs Channel: 

Uzbekistan Day 1: Tashkent

On Day 1 in Uzbekistan we went on an ultimate Uzbek street food tour in Tashkent, including the biggest bazaar in the city, and the most massive plov (rice pilau) cooking in Tashkent.

We had arrived at the airport in Tashkent at about 4 am in the morning, and at 9 am we were ready to start eating our way through the city. 

First we met up with Bekruz and Akbar both from the Ministry of Tourism Uzbekistan (Bekruz is the one who invited me to Uzbekistan and arranged everything for us, so thank you Bekruz!), and Ravshan (check out his channel: ), a local food vlogger in Uzbekistan.

Two of the most important phrases you should know in Uzbek are:
Assalomu Alaykum - Hello / Greeting
Rahmat - Thank you

Bread Bazaar, Tashkent - We started this ultimate street food tour at the bread bazaar in Tashkent, a market dedicated fully to bread, with a little fruit and other things mixed in. We bought some break, some kaymak, and some fruit and then went to a nearby restaurant where they laid everything on the table for us, along with tea. Uzbek breakfast was a great way to get started.

Chorsu Bazaar - The grandest bazaar in Tashkent is Chorus Bazaar, and it‚Äôs a perfect place to get a feel of Uzbek culture and food. We first stopped at the food court to try hanum, a type of dumpling filled with potato and somsa. Then we continued to the dome shaped iconic part of the bazaar, filled with fresh meat and spices. It‚Äôs one of the coolest market structures anywhere in the world.

Plov Center - We kind of had to rush out of Chorsu Bazaar because although they prepare 1,500 Kilos, seriously, of rice plov per day, it only takes 2 - 3 hours before they run out everyday. So we got there, already one of the monster swimming pool pans was finished, but they still had a few others going and serving. Plov is the national dish of Uzbekistan, a food that‚Äôs eaten on every and all occasions. For Tashkent plov, it‚Äôs pretty heavy on the meat at oil, with rice, chickpeas, and raisins. Also it included, qazi - horsemeat sausage which is a delicacy. It was incredibly delicious, and proper meal experience.
Total price - 100,000 UZS ($12.21)

Plov is love, remember that when you‚Äôre in Uzbekistan.

National Food Restaurant - After strolling around for a while in the afternoon, we continued to a National Food restaurant, a laid back family style restaurant that serves all things Uzbek food. Along with a number of dishes, the main dish I was most interested in was the naryn, thin slices of dough mixed with minced meat and horse. It was interesting, and quite good, as were the other dishes.
Total price - 110,000 UZS ($13.43)

Sultan Suleyman Restaurant - For dinner we went to a bit of a fancy trendy restaurant, and had another platter of food. This time, dough noodle like sheets topped with meat, horse sausage again, and green onions.
Total price - 122,000 UZS ($14.90)

It was a day of learning, eating, and meeting some amazing people along the way. Thank you for watching this Uzbekistan food tour!

1243,CgPXS7K0hJ4,"These 8 ""Healthy"" Foods are Making You Fat!","Get ripped in 90 days - http://athleanx.com/x/my-workouts
Subscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW

Eating healthy is a requirement if you want to get ripped and lose body fat fast.  The problem is, often times foods masquerade themselves as healthy when they are anything but.  In this video, I show you how to spot the 8 biggest healthy foods making you fat.  We call these trap foods because they sneak up on you when you least expect it.

I don‚Äôt care how much you are training or working out, if you refuse to get your nutrition in check you will never look as lean as you should or could.  Proper nutrition and good food choices are required to get ripped.  What I hate however is when you are misled into thinking that certain foods should be in your diet because they are ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù.  You blindly trust the guidance and then wind up frustrated when you aren‚Äôt seeing the results for your efforts.  In order to fix this once and for all, you simply have to educate yourself about these traps so you can avoid them in favor of better choices.

First up is guacamole.  Recently, I did a video on how the healthy fats in avocado are great for your body.  The problem is, people confuse healthy foods for lean foods.  Packing a huge calorie wallop with every tablespoon, we tend to overlook the impact eating this food can quickly have on our waistline by eating almost 10-12 tablespoons per serving on average.  Sure, healthy fats are healthy, but like anything else‚Ä¶eaten in excess you will quickly run into trouble with them.

Low fat or lite versions of foods are often way worse than the full fat, regular versions.  Beyond the fact that they usually just do a sugar for fat swap, you‚Äôre also getting a bunch of chemicals thrown in to these highly processed foods that you probably want to avoid all together.

Now I know a lot of people like to have their morning glass of OJ or other fruit juice, but if you are looking to get ripped then you are far better off opting for water and getting your fruit in solid form.  The amount of sugars packed into these ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù drinks is astounding.  In fact, you are likely to find that a comparison between them and a glass of soda yield almost the same amount.  Add in the fact that liquid calories are far too easy to consume (and don‚Äôt provide the fiber benefits of the solid forms) and you‚Äôve got another reason to avoid these.

Sushi is supposed to be a healthy food option that packs a protein punch in the process.  Not so fast.  In fact, with just a sliver of fish in every piece, you‚Äôre getting just 15% protein and instead packing in the starchy carbs with enough sticky rice to hold a small fort together!  Add in the sodium IV drip you‚Äôre getting from your ‚Äúlow sodium‚Äù soy sauce and you‚Äôve just made another perfect trap food.  Opt for the sashimi instead and you‚Äôll get what you thought you were getting when you iniitally decided on having sushi.

There‚Äôs something about the word granola that just sounds so healthy.  Maybe it‚Äôs that it sounds like the word grain?  Whatever the case, you can‚Äôt ignore the fact that this is made up of calorically dense ingredients that just won‚Äôt play well in an attempt to lose fat.  If you don‚Äôt make it yourself then you‚Äôre going to be guaranteeing yourself a ton of sugar and syrup as well, as both are needed to hold all of this ‚Äúgoodness‚Äù together.

There are more trap foods not covered here in the description but you will find in this video.  You want to be sure if you are not avoiding them all together that you are at least educated about their pitfalls so you can limit them in your diet when you are trying to get and stay lean.  If you are looking for a complete meal plan to help you get ripped and stay ripped step by step, be sure to head to  and get the ATHLEAN-X Training System.

CURITIBA, BRAZIL - Curitiba is located in the Paran√° state of southern Brazil. It‚Äôs a pleasant city, and they known especially for meat. In this video we go on a Brazilian food tour of Curitiba, explore some of the iconic meat dishes of the city, and eat a 5 kilo family sandwich!   

Mercearia Fantinato - Carne de on√ßa (Jaguar meat), known as jaguar meat, yet of course not jaguar at all, this steak tartare (raw minced beef) got its name because of the raw meat breath you‚Äôll have after you eat it. It‚Äôs mixed table-side, and it‚Äôs delicious.
Price - 53.99 BRL ($13.54)

Costel√£o do Ga√∫cho - One of the things that Curitiba is known for, and all of southern Brazil, is meat - and especially the beef ribs are among the prized cut. Costel√£o do Ga√∫cho is an amazing restaurant that specializes in beef ribs. The owner is a master, treating each rack of ribs with respect and roasting and smoking them with precision. I loved his table saw method of cutting the ribs. The ribs were outstanding, as was the entire meal with all the side salads and dishes.

4 Beans Coffee Co. - We stopped in for a quick coffee, but that turned into a coffee roasting session, which was fantastic.

Lanchonete da Lombada - Here we go, the mega 5 kg. Lombada sandwich. Lombada means speedbump in Portuguese, because it was formerly a street food stall right in front of the speedbump. It was just insane, huge bun, layers of meat, hot dogs, massive quantities of squeeze cheese. It‚Äôs not a food challenge, but a very popular local family meal in Curitiba, Brazil. Total price - 50 BRL ($12.45)

Tio Dog (Uncle Dog) - Probably one of the most iconic of all the Brazilian fast food in Curitiba is TIo Dog, specialising in a number of different sandwiches and hot dogs. We got The Philadelphia, a bun filled with hot dogs, a variety of unknown sauces, and little crunchy chip fries. It‚Äôs one of those late night impulse foods - not something I‚Äôd eat on a daily basis.

Curitiba was fun, and it was a Brazilian food tour of meat!

¬ª THE SEAFOOD

1. DOMANNAKA: Mackerel Sashimi + Uni (Sea Urchin) + Dancing Tiger Shrimp 
ADDRESS: 101-0025 Tokyo, Chiyoda, Kanda Sakumacho 3-37-4 
OPEN: 4PM - 12AM 

ü¶ê Domannaka is based in Hokkaido, Tokyo, with 6 locations across the city. They are known for their unique dishes, primarily seafood served while it is still alive. They offer delicacies such as squid, mackerel and trevally. We tried their living mackerel sashimi, uni (sea urchin) and dancing tiger shrimp.

üí∏PRICE: Mackerel (saba) 8.59 USD/6,980 JPY for whole fish | Uni (sea urchin) USD/2,500 JPY per plate (13-20 sea urchins) | Tiger Shrimp (odorigui) USD/890 JPY per shrimp
----
2. TAKAMARU FRESH FISH STORE: Oyster + Ankimo (Monkfish Liver) + Anko Nabe (Monkfish Hotpot) + Deep Fried Monkfish 
ADDRESS: 950-1 Oshimata | Seven Park Ario KAshiwa 1F, Kashiwa 277-0922, Chiba Prefecture 
OPEN: 11AM - 9PM

üêüTakamaru Fresh Fish Store serves some of Tokyo‚Äôs finest fish delicacies. Among their delicacies is monkfish, a very rare fish that is hard to find in Tokyo, even in big fish markets. Monkfish liver (ankimo) is typically considered the tastiest part of the fish and was even listed on CNN‚Äôs 2011 list of the World‚Äôs 50 Most Delicious Foods. We were fortunate enough to get a taste of this dish, which is not a typical menu item at Takamaru Fresh Fish Store. Monkfish hotpot is a bit more common than monkfish liver, frequently eaten during the winter months in Japan.

1282,9w8sK58x,Food for warriors: Making ‚ÄòKulesh‚Äô in a WWII field kitchen - Taste of Russia Ep.2,"More films about food and cooking: https://rtd.rt.com/tags/food-and-cook...
Necessity, as they say, is the mother of invention and that‚Äôs true of many traditional dishes around the world. Once created for lack of better options, some foods win hearts ‚Äì and stomachs ‚Äì because they taste great and are easy to make. A good example is kulesh, a millet dish known as ‚Äòwarrior food‚Äô because it can easily be cooked on an open fire. It was the staple dish for Soviet soldiers during World War II, and a modified version is prepared in Russian homes to this day.

To learn to make authentic Soviet army kulesh, Oscar and Glen join a group of military reenactors at the famous Khatenki airfield, where the legendary French Normandie-Niemen Fighter Aviation Regiment lived and worked side by side with Russian mechanics.

After chopping vegetables for the dish and wood for fuel, they spark up a real World War II military field kitchen and begin to assemble the ingredients. To Glen‚Äôs surprise, they include canned meat compliments of Uncle Sam‚Äôs Lend-Lease program. When the kulesh is ready, it needs to be delivered to the troops. Glen is tasked with carrying heavy food containers through the natural obstacle course of a snowy forest while under ‚Äòfriendly fire‚Äô from a machine gun. That kulesh had better be good!

For a close up look at an authentic WWII Russian field kitchen, check out Taste of Russia, Episode 2.

1283,6HngwHe3QCA,"Village Food in AMAZON RAINFOREST - Lemongrass Ants + EXOTIC Energy Drinks! | Manaus, Brazil!","üé•Street Food Tour in Rio de Janeiro: https://youtu.be/TlWDF3BfUdo
üçåBanana Chips available now!! 
üëïT-shirts: 

Thanks to Guilherme () for taking us around Brazil.   

MANAUS, BRAZIL - During my food trip to Brazil there was no place I wanted to visit more than the Amazon Rainforest. We flew to Manaus (if you look at a map, Manaus is directly in the heart center of the Amazon). The jungle, the unique dishes and fruits, and the people made it incredible.

Exotic fruit tasting - One of the things that you have to do when you‚Äôre in Brazil, especially in the Amazon is sample all the unique and indigenous fruits of the region, some that are only available there. We started with mari-mari, an amazing long pod fruit and have inga (ice cream bean fruit) and birib√° - wild sugar apple. All the fruit - 10 BRL ($2.55)

Manaus is a pretty big city, especially for being in the heart of the Amazon Rainforest. They have a big market, full of fruits, vegetables and fish. We headed straight for some tucum√£, a type of palm tree fruit that‚Äôs essential in the local diet.

Jenipapo - Along the way we also tried some jenipapo, a pretty unique fruit.

Tucum√£ sandwiches - Sandwich shop owners better take note! Tucum√£ sandwiches are a true Amazonian food and they are delicious. Along with the palm fruit they were paired with cheese and fried sweet banana. It‚Äôs a perfect breakfast and way to start the day in the Amazon. Price - about 10 BRL ($2.55) per sandwich

Tambaqui fish - Tambaqui is a fish from the Amazon that‚Äôs known for having ribs - seriously almost like pork ribs. We decided to get a fish to bring to the village since we weren‚Äôt sure what they‚Äôd have al the village.

Amazon village - We didn‚Äôt really have a plan, we were just going to find a boat driver and ask him to take us to a village and see if anyone could cool. So we got a boat, and our boat driver asked if they were home and if we could invite ourselves in. We arrived completely unplanned and unannounced and it turned out to be an outstanding learning experience and fun time with an amazing family in the Amazon.

Along with the food we brought, the family mixed up about 4 different exotic drinks - some of them known in the Western world as ingredients in trendy energy drinks - but here in the Amazon of Brazil they are consumed regularly.

It was such an awesome Brazilian Amazonian food meal with the family followed by a time of drumming and dancing, football, and finally a swim in the river. It was an extraordinary day in the Amazon of Brazil.

1287,CyI5JBR,7 DAY WATER FAST - NO FOOD FOR A WEEK (Before & After),"DISCLAIMER: We are not doctors, nor experts on fasting. We do not recommend anyone do a medically unsupervised water fast. If we had not been in Northern Spain when Lou got injured, he would have gone to True North Health Center () in California to do his water fast with the support of their medical team. If you are under 18 years old, on medication, addicted to any substances, have currently or had a history of eating disorders, are pregnant or breastfeeding, have heart problems or any other diseases it is even more important that you seek the advice of a medical professional before attempting a water fast on your own. 

It might sound really crazy to you, but Lou did a 7 DAY WATER FAST! If you've never heard of a water fast, it is very simple: don't eat any food or drink anything other than pure filtered water for a specified amount of time, so for Lou that was one entire week without any food, no coffee, no tea, no lemon water, no juice, or vitamins - just plain filtered water and rest. 

You might be familiar with the trendy diet called Intermittent Fasting. Here people only eat in a certain window of time (16 hr fast/9 hr feed or 14 hr fast/10 hr feed) and while this has lots of touted health benefits, Lou was in need of relief fast from a horrible back injury and decided he'd do whatever he could to get results quickly as possible. One of the main benefits of fasting is the body's ability to reduce inflammation. Instead of spending lots of energy digesting food, the body can now work to rebuild the immune system and while there still aren't many long term trials of fasting's effects on humans, science is showing that fasting can be used to help treat a whole host of problems like heart disease, diabetes, some cancers, high blood pressure, and autoimmune diseases. Over 6 years ago Lou was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis, which is an autoimmune disease where the body attacks the joints, and over the course of the last few years has been able to get off medication and manage his symptoms with the help of a low-fat oil free plant based vegan diet. However, when he does stray from a health-promoting diet his RA symptoms do begin to resurface. So while we're not sure if his back injury had to do with his RA, either way, the autoimmune disease makes his healing process extremely slow. We live in a van, so being immobile was actually a very scary experience, and left Lou to embark on this water fasting journey.  The before and after is astounding as his pain levels went from an 8 out of 10 to... well you have to watch for that! 

Before we get to the video, I just wanted to say that a lot of people come to water fasting searching for a quick fix for weight loss and I really recommend that you reconsider. Water fasting is a wonderful tool to manage health conditions with the help of doctor supervision, but when it comes to weight loss it might not be your most effective tool because if post fast you continue all the same habits you will be left in the same position. If you are searching for weight loss please research a low-fat plant-based diet, but mainly I want you to really think about where the desire to lose weight is coming from. Our society tells us constantly that we are not good enough and instead of buying into this lie, this might be the time you instead embrace yourself as you are. Focus on self-love, body-acceptance, and finding self-worth outside of ascetics. Diet culture is toxic, and while I know it's complicated for me to write about it as we are huge advocates for a low-fat vegan diet as its been an incredible tool to manage Lou's autoimmune disease, in the end, I want people to know that they are worthy as is. No crazy lifestyle changes will change your relationship to yourself unless you do the mental work. 

Thanks for being here with us and while I know water fasting might make a lot of people uncomfortable it was an incredible experience for Lou and I hope you can see how much it helped him.

1292,NGxcr_Z8D,5 Must-Try Japanese Food Experiences in Tokyo,"Japanese Food is awesome, and the overall dining experience is just as fun. If you are looking for places to eat in Tokyo, here are five great Japanese food experiences that I love while living in Tokyo. 

1. Japanese Grill (Robata) - You sit around a few men who cook all of the meat and vegetables right in front of you on a grill. You just point to what you want and they grab it with their giant wooden spatulas. 

2. Ramen - My favorite Japanese food, and perhaps the most well recognized Japanese dish apart from sushi. There are hundreds of places to choose from in Tokyo, each with their own rendition of the classic. One spot where you can get a large variety of options is on ""Ramen Street"" in the lower level of Tokyo Station. 

3. Yakitori - Meat and veggies on sticks, cooked over a similar grill as the Robata, Yakitori is a favorite among Tokyo residents because it's fast and goes great with beer. The most famous area for Yakitori in Tokyo is down ""Memory Lane"" or ""Piss Alley"" just outside the Shinjuku Train Station. 

4. Chanko Nabe - The ultimate in gluttony for a normal civilian, but a necessary bulking strategy for up-and-coming sumo wresters in the Ryogoku neighborhood of Tokyo. There are many different versions of this massive stew, and they are all aggressive and delicious. 

5. Conveyor Belt Sushi - As I mention in the video, there are a million different ways sushi is served in Tokyo. One of the most fun methods is by way of the conveyor belt sushi. 

*Bonus* - Convenient stores such as FamilyMart, Lawson's, and 7 Eleven are a major part of Japanese Food culture in Tokyo. People are busy and need a quick meal, so I wanted to take you around real quick and show you what's inside!

1299,LwBUfB7hU6A,The race to save endangered foods,"Wild animals aren‚Äôt the only ones facing extinction.

Join the Video Lab! http://bit.ly/video-lab

We‚Äôre letting foods we‚Äôve eaten for thousands of years disappear from farmers‚Äô fields, and from our plates. Saving them isn‚Äôt just a matter of cultural preservation. In the next 30 years, we‚Äôre going to need to learn how to feed more people on a hotter planet, and the more genetic varieties we lose, the harder it‚Äôll be to adapt. 

To learn more about the foods facing extinction in the US and around the world, check out the Ark of Taste, a project of Slow Food USA.

Journalist Mark Shapiro‚Äôs book, Seeds of Resistance, goes into much more detail about the risk that genetic homogeneity poses to our food supply. He also profiles some of the efforts, many led by indigenous communities, to preserve older seed varieties. 

For more on seed relabeling, check out the Farmers Business Network‚Äôs 2018 Seed Relabeling Report.

The chart on declining global yields for corn, wheat, and rice comes from an article in the academic journal Disasters and Climate Change Economics from agricultural economists Mekbib G. Haile, Tesfamicheal Wossen, Kindie Tesfaye, and Joachim von Braun. Their prediction model takes into account both climate change and price volatility, which is why their estimates are higher than those of some other researchers.

1305,5RwIWGkMxrE,How Corporations Ruined Food (Food Industry Documentary) - Real Stories,"When we walk into a supermarket, we assume that we have the widest possible choice of healthy foods. But in fact, over the course of the 20th century, our food system was co-opted by corporate forces whose interests do not lie in providing the public with fresh, healthy, sustainably-produced food.

Fortunately for America, an alternative emerged from the counter-culture of California in the late 1960s and early 1970s, where a group of political anti-corporate protesters‚Äìled by Alice Waters‚Äìvoiced their dissent by creating a food chain outside of the conventional system. The unintended result was the birth of a vital local-sustainable-organic food movement which has brought back taste and variety to our tables.

FOOD FIGHT is a fascinating look at how American agricultural policy and food culture developed in the 20th century, and how the California food movement has created a counter-revolution against big agribusiness.

More people have food allergies than ever before. Peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, eggs, and even milk‚Ä¶ the list of possibly dangerous foods seems to get longer every day. But why do some people‚Äôs bodies have deadly reactions food?  And why are food allergies on the rise?

1315,i9RDaf8j2Yg,Part 15: Food: How Healthy Was Medieval Food?,"It can be hard to stick to a diet in modern times when eating out. It was much the same for a medieval knight, so when he was dining in his own household his personal physician would work with his cook to keep their master in peak condition. In this episode, Jason and food historian Chris Carr discuss the medieval understanding of nutrition and how it affected the knight‚Äôs diet, as well as the influence of spices and how they defined one‚Äôs social standing.

1323,f9P5Phj0TFY,A taste of conflict: The politics of food in Jerusalem - Street Food,"The ancient city of Jerusalem is sacred to three different faiths: for Jews it is the site of their first holy temple; for Christians it is the scene of Jesus Christ's death and resurrection; and for Muslims it is the location of the Prophet Muhammad's ascent to heaven.

A site of vast historical and religious significance, this beautiful city is also a tragic one - fought over for centuries and coveted by millions who have never set foot in it. It is at the heart of the ongoing and seemingly irresolvable Israeli-Palestinian conflict and everything there is overshadowed by politics.

Jerusalem's old city enthralls with its bustling markets and vibrant street life, but inside its walls, tensions are never far from the surface. History is a dimension of the present and there is little unity to be found in a city which Palestinians regard as their occupied capital.

In the struggle for the soul of a city, even food - a marker of identity, an expression of history, culture, and values - plays a part, and the roots of certain foods are fiercely debated.

For Palestinians, denied a state and with a national identity which is constantly undermined, food plays an even greater role in defining who they are.

Almost half of Israeli Jews come from Middle Eastern backgrounds where their parents and grandparents lived alongside Arabs in countries such as Iraq, Yemen and Morocco. Many dishes are a reminder of the shared history and culture of Arabs and Jews - something easily forgotten in today's divided politics. 

In a city where Israelis and Palestinians attach great meaning and symbolism to food - whether religious, political or both - we visit a unique place, Eucalyptus, which is jointly owned by Palestinians and Israelis.

There, we sample dishes made by an Israeli Jew, a Palestinian Muslim, an Armenian, and a Palestinian Christian who, as 'Chefs for Peace', cook together to bridge religious and political divides. Convinced that ignorance about the other is at the heart of the conflict, the chefs try to educate people about others' history, traditions, and culture through the medium of food. 

This film was first broadcast on Al Jazeera English in July 2008.

-    If you want to cook something cool ‚Äì try to prepare tornado potatoes. Push a wooden skewer through the center of each potato. Using a sharp knife carefully cut in a spiral motion from one side to other. Now divide the potato slices to give them some space and bake
-    If you need to quickly cut avocados, use a grill rack
-    Replace a knife with dental floss to cut a cake

1329,PVEeScXdSVU,Philippines STRANGEST food! ETAG in Sagada | Travel Philippines Vlog,"I'm a huge fan of Filipino food. Street food in the Philippines is some of my favourite because a lot of it is so different interesting, and tasty. 
As a foreigner in the Philippines...Why go to a Filipino restaurant when you can get delicious Pinoy street food, and be eating Balut, Isaw, and other strange foods? Manila especially is great for this!

Just a few days before getting my Kalinga Tattoo from Whang Od in Buscalan we visited an Igorot village elder to get his permission to visit his ancestors at a hanging coffin site in Sagada. He was smoking a very important type of Igorot food called Etag. Etag is used in ceremonies in this part of the Philippines, I was interested in trying it because the traditional way of preserving it, invited maggots, beatles and all other sorts of insects into the process. 

I'm so happy I was able to spend such quality time with Lakay Wa-Ow, try on his ceremonial necklace, and also buy his Etag. 

I'm excited to share the second part at Amir's Birthday Party. Stay tuned!

Inspired by the Best ever food review show and their various interesting Filipino travel vlogs about foods like Catching and eating Wild Tamilok in Palawan.... Is this Philippines Strangest or Scariest Food? 

Where are my Filipino and Filipina subscribers at!? Would you try this?

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Flint (Bill Hader) and the gang discover an island of living food animals.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Picking up precisely where its hit predecessor left off, Sony Pictures Animation's Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 finds Flint Lockwood (voice of Bill Hader) invited to join the Live Corp Company, and use his gift for invention for the good of mankind. Just as young Flint prepares to go to work for his hero Chester V (voice of Will Forte), however, the young genius learns that his water-to-food machine is not only still functional, but it's also started cross-breeding animals with food. Now, in order to prevent a growing army of ""foodimals"" from escaping isolation on an island and wreaking havoc on the mainland, Flint and his loyal group of friends will have to do battle with such delicious, but deadly, hybrids as the ferocious tacodiles, slithering apple pie-thons, and vine-swinging shrimpanzees. Saving the world from these rampaging monstrosities won't be easy, but if anyone is up to the task, it's Flint and company. Cody Cameron and Kris Pearn takes the reins for this sequel also featuring vocal contributions by Anna Faris, James Caan, Kristen Schaal, Terry Crews, Andy Samberg, Neil Patrick Harris, and Benjamin Bratt.

1358,U8u1Aydxjl4,10 Normal Foods That Are BANNED In Other Countries,"Popular food you cannot find in other countries.
Subscribe: https://goo.gl/cv6b96
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Meat, milk, cereal, and fruit are products Americans consume on a regular basis. But did you know that some of these products are completely banned in other countries? They contain substances and chemicals that might be approved by the FDA, but are illegal by any other food administration. Let‚Äôs explore 10 foods banned in other countries!


Let‚Äôs start with artificial dyes. You probably know that M&Ms and other sweets contain artificial dyes that contribute to the product‚Äôs color and make it more appealing. But those dyes have been banned in Europe and many other countries around the world and replaced with natural dyes as they contain several harmful substances!

Wild salmon is considered as one of the healthiest foods with plenty of nutritional benefits. But did you know that many countries banned farm-raised salmon? Wait until you hear just how harmful salmon is for the environment and why it‚Äôs been banned in Australia as well as New Zealand!

We often hear about zero-calorie chips which are considered healthy. It‚Äôs due to a fat substitute called Olestra. But this substitute seems to have negative effects on our health! While it removes fat from products, it actually stops the body from receiving some of the most essential vitamins and nutrients, which is why it was banned in Canada and Europe.

Do you consume meat, Rice Krispies, sports drinks, calorie-free snacks, fruit, or GMO food? All of those have been banned from countries around the world because they include harmful substances that have negative effects on your health!

#10 Prime Meat
The prime cut meats that smaller restaurants and corporations sell are one of the biggest complaints that high-end chefs and physicians make. That‚Äôs because ‚Äòprime cut‚Äô suggests that it is a single cut of the best meat from the animal.
But this isn‚Äôt the case in many restaurants. Actually, what if I told you they chop up all the leftover meat and glue it back together? Does the word transglutaminase ring a bell? This is the name for the meat glue they use to glue the low quality meat back together to make you think you‚Äôre getting a full piece. This is more than a lie, this is disgusting. 
Besides the fact that it is using the worst tiny cuts of meat, it‚Äôs made from ammonia. The stuff used in fertilizers and oven cleaners. They try to fight back by claiming it kills E Coli, which should not be something we should be worried about being on meat anyway. Justifying making people unknowingly eat ammonia just so they can pass off scrap meat does not seem ethical in the least. Be very careful where you eat your steak! See, this is why being a vegetarian seems like a safer option! Or maybe seafood‚Ä¶.
#9 Imitation Crab
Or maybe not seafood. For one, crustaceans feed off the worst possible debris on the bottom of the ocean. The only nastier creature is shrimp. This stuff they eat doesn‚Äôt magically disappear when they are caught and cooked either. There‚Äôs still‚Ä¶stuff in it that we eat‚Ä¶secondhand.
Nevertheless, it‚Äôs expensive to buy fresh crab and shrimp, but you can get crab cakes and other delicacies at the grocery store for a pretty good price. Why? It‚Äôs usually because it is fake, under the guise of imitation crab meat.
Imitation crab meat is made from the remains of other fish that are mushed together, and injected into a mold. They mince and mince random fish, whatever they can get their hands on, until it turns into the same texture as crab. It is then created into a paste that is frozen and then shaved into crab-like flakes. To make it taste like crab, they just add flavor and paint it to look like crab. 
So, next time you go for some cheap crab, remember that‚Äôs probably, beaten, frozen, shaved, and painted fish remains. I kind of like imitation crab but not really a fan of this process...it still tastes good so if you‚Äôre okay with this‚Ä¶then go ahead. 
#8 Parmesan Cheese
Parmesan cheese is delicious! Especially, real authentic parmesan cheese. But did you know that companies will usually lie about what‚Äôs in ‚Äúparmesan‚Äù?
The FDA regulations make it legal to sell fake Parmesan cheese. This is some scary stuff. There are two huge deal breakers with parmesan. One is grated parmesan in the shaker. Most of the time, cellulose and mold inhibitor chemicals are added so it won‚Äôt clump. Cellulose, not cellulite, that‚Äôs just an after effect. Cellulose comes from ground up wood pulp and is considered ‚Äúharmless and organic matter‚Äù. 
They usually add 2-4% cellulose, but the FDA doesn‚Äôt restrict it. In fact, some has been proven to carry 20%! That‚Äôs a lot of cellulose on your pasta! 
The saddest part is, this is just allowed in the United States. Parmesan cheese legally means the kind of cheese that comes from Parma, Italy. But in the US, you can call it parmesan when it‚Äôs just dehydrated, grated mozzarella.
This is like the Kobe beef of cheeses. Most of the time, when you get parmesan, it‚Äôs not parmesan. It‚Äôs cellulose and a mixture of cheap cheeses.
#7 Egg Substitute
This one is a little different. No one knows what it is, but many believe that it‚Äôs a great substitute for people with egg allergies. But really, it‚Äôs still just eggs. 
They take mostly egg whites, fresh, frozen, or powdered, and add other ingredients. But not much. They actually just contain 99% egg whites! There‚Äôs not actually much substituting going on. It might be easier for people who don‚Äôt want to go to the trouble dealing with egg shells and yolks slipping everywhere, etc. 
In reality, it is called egg substitute because of that 1% that‚Äôs just artificial coloring,  salt, onion powder, and who knows what else. Why? Why would they just flavor egg whites? ‚ÄúEgg substitute‚Äù is kind of misleading and should be for people with egg allergies who need a substitute. It shouldn‚Äôt just be eggs. 
Maybe it‚Äôs substituting something else? Is it the bottle substituting for the shell? Bottom line is‚Ä¶this isn‚Äôt egg substitute, it‚Äôs just expensive eggs.",Food

1367,1r0ocJbsY-g,Snacking through the Big Apple: Food carts in NYC - Street Food,"Snacking through the Big Apple: Food carts in NYC - Street Food

Exploring the cultural diversity exemplified throughout the vibrant street food scene in New York City.
Known as the Big Apple, New York City is home to about nine million people [‚âà population of Honduras, nation] and hosts an additional 40 million visitors every year, which makes for a lot of stomachs to feed. 

Quick snacks, above all the hot dog, are as synonymous with New York as yellow cabs and skyscrapers and reflect the city's eclectic ethnic mix.

Yet few people realise that many of the city's thousands of street vendors - including Brooklyn's famed 'Falafel King' - face a daily struggle that belies the city's wealthy and glamourous image.

As the first signs of Manhattan's morning hustle and bustle surface, the city's street vendors have already been at work for many hours. Storage garages are busy with the sound of these business owners cleaning and gleaming, stocking and getting things in order for their long days ahead.

Although there are many vendors native to NYC, there is a significant number of immigrant owners - many of whom have run their businesses for decades.

Their food carts symbolise a lot more than a quick and convenient snack for the hundreds of thousands that pound the pavements of the city. They are a chance to live life on their own terms, often after escaping political turmoil or significant economic instability in their homelands. 

But the challenge is far from ideal. Obstacles to a successful business range from finding the perfect selling spot - in spite of an unspoken brotherhood between the vendors that can and has led to rivalries - and adhering to legislation surrounding health and safety, to liquidity and endless working hours. 

On the other side of the river, street vendors in Brooklyn and Queens face an even tougher uphill battle. Catering to a rougher demographic, and often without the means - both financial and otherwise - food cart owners, many of whom are new to the US, tend to find themselves operating illegally and, at times, even dangerously. 

Follow this episode of Street Food to get a glimpse into the good, the bad and the delicious of New York's vendors.

Eating the best Dutch street food in Amsterdam

PATRON: 

In this video, I show you where to find the very best Amsterdam food! I take you on a walking tour of the Albert Cuyp Market in Amsterdam where I taste test many different Dutch street food items. 

Named after a 17th century painter, Albert Cuyp, the market has since become an institution for this bustling European city. Located on the Albert Cuypstraat (that is the name of the street) between Ferdinand Bolstraat and Van Woustraat...the market's central location makes it the perfect place to stroll through on the way to a nearby museum or on the way to a picnic. 

Visiting the Albert Cuyp Market is a definite must-see when you're in Amsterdam! Another plus is that this market is great for travelers on a budget because there are a lot of Amsterdam food options (traditional Dutch dishes) that can be had for under $3 Euro. 

A list of Amsterdam street food I ate at the Albert Cuyp Market:

I began with my favorite item, the stroopwafel. When I think of Amsterdam food, stroopwafel is the first thing that comes to mind. Essentially it is a waffle, but it's nothing like an American waffle. This unique pastry is made with flour, butter and sugar, but the real excitement is in the middle of the waffle. The waffle is cut in the middle (which is a miracle because it is so thin!) and then copious amounts of brown sugar syrup are knifed onto it, and then it is sealed once again. Stroopwafel is best eaten warm! The predominant flavor is cinnamon and the waffle itself is both crisp on the outside but soft inside. It's absolutely delightful and it tasted a lot different than I was expecting. 

Next, I tried some raw herring called Nieuwe Herring which translates into ‚ÄúNew Herring.‚ÄùThis means that the fish has either been caught that actual day or the day prior. Nieuwe Herring is another must try dish when it comes taste testing Amsterdam food! Since it was herring season in the summertime (until around Sept), I decided to try out some fresh herring the Dutch way (with pickles and raw onions). It was absolutely incredible! I am now a herring addict.

After this I drank some fresh pressed raspberry juice mixed with blackberries and orange juice. You can find juice stands all along the market. A normal glass of juice costs around 1 EUR. 

Then after this, I moved onto a spicy chicken sandwich at Benny's Chicken. This food stand claims to have the best chicken in all of Amsterdam. After tasting their spicy chicken sandwich covered in cheese, I have to admit that is was really good! The pieces of chicken are succulent and juicy. Definitely a delicious sandwich if you're craving something cheesy!

After this I bought some dates at Ron's Notenbar. Notenbars (which literally translates into ‚Äúnut bar‚Äù) are a very common sight in Amsterdam. There are a couple notenbars at the Albert Cuyp Market and they all offer different items which is nice. Duchies love their fresh fruits and nuts, especially as a mid-day snack! I was impressed by their selection of dates, but I highly recommend getting a couple bags of different dried fruits and nuts.  

Next, I purchased some aged gouda cheese at a cheese shop called Daalder Kaas. They sell traditionally ripened cheese and an array of aged gouda cheeses. I selected an aged gouda cheese which I thought was nice and creamy. It had a sharp flavor, but wasn't overwhelming. 

I thought all of the Amsterdam food I tasted at the market was wonderful!  Make sure to come earlier than 5pm as some vendors tend to pack up around 3pm (or when they sell out of the goods). It's best to arrive in the early afternoon.

1370,go_QOzc79U,Teach every child about food | Jamie Oliver,"http://www.ted.com Sharing powerful stories from his anti-obesity project in Huntington, W. Va., TED Prize winner Jamie Oliver makes the case for an all-out assault on our ignorance of food.

Jamie Oliver is transforming the way we feed ourselves, and our children. Jamie Oliver has been drawn to the kitchen since he was a child working in his father's pub-restaurant. He showed not only a precocious culinary talent but also a passion for creating (and talking about) fresh, honest, delicious food. In the past decade, the shaggy-haired ""Naked Chef"" of late-'90s BBC2 has built a worldwide media conglomerate of TV shows, books, cookware and magazines, all based on a formula of simple, unpretentious food that invites everyone to get busy in the kitchen. And as much as his cooking is generous, so is his business model -- his Fifteen Foundation, for instance, trains young chefs from challenged backgrounds to run four of his restaurants.

Now, Oliver is using his fame and charm to bring attention to the changes that Brits and Americans need to make in their lifestyles and diet. Campaigns such as Jamie's School Dinner, Ministry of Food and Food Revolution USA combine Olivers culinary tools, cookbooks and television, with serious activism and community organizing -- to create change on both the individual and governmental level.

Join Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution:

1372,W2L_02p-xn,6 High Estrogen Foods MEN SHOULD AVOID!,"These are 6 High Estrogen Foods Men Should Avoid to build muscle, lose weight, and get lean. Some foods should be limited and others should be completely avoided. Instead of increasing estrogen most men want to learn how to increase testosterone naturally & fast. By learning how to decrease estrogen levels, weight loss becomes much easier.

The next food that you'll want to limit to keep your estrogen levels down is wheat and grain based products. These foods are extremely high in a type of xenoestrogen known as zearalenone or ZEA. ZEA is molecularly similar to estrogen and acts like estrogen in the body. One study examined the effect that ZEAs had on a drug called Letrozole, which is specifically designed to lower estrogen levels in the body. Bodybuilders will often take it get to really low levels of body fat. The researchers found that, even small amounts of ZEA negated the effects of Letrozole. That‚Äôs a powerful indicator of the estrogen boosting effect of all those ZEA‚Äôs that are found in wheat and grain products. As well as the ZEA problem, wheat also contains phytoestrogens. They‚Äôre found in the wheat germ which is the reproductive part of the wheat seed. These phytoestrogens will bind to estrogen receptor sites in your body‚Äôs cells. In a study that was designed to investigate the combined effect of wheat germ and a breast cancer treatment pharmaceutical it was noted that one of the side effects of wheat germ was that it increased estrogen receptor activity of MCF-7 cells. However, refined grain products remove the germ, making them slightly less of a problem when it comes to estrogen. Overall though, you should limit your consumption of wheat and grain based products. Our third estrogen food type to avoid is processed carbs and refined sugars. Hopefully, you‚Äôve already cut back on these types of foods if you're trying to bring your body fat levels down. But there‚Äôs an extra reason to ditch these types of carbs. And it has to do with that powerful blood sugar regulating hormone, insulin. As well as causing you to store more body fat, insulin lowers your body‚Äôs levels of what is known as sex hormone binding globulin. The job of this globulin is to bind the two sex hormones, testosterone and estrogen, together. When it's doing its job properly, you will have limited amounts of free estrogen in your body. But, when it's stopped from doing its job, the opposite will be the case, your free estrogen levels will be much higher. It‚Äôs the insulin response that occurs when you eat refined sugar foods that causes the interference in the activity of sex hormone binding globulin. An interesting study that focused on women showed that drinking sugar laden sodas increased estrogen levels. The interesting thing was that increased estrogen levels did not occur with either diet sodas or fruit juices. Researchers believe this is due to the fact that diet sodas don‚Äôt contain refined sugar and fruit juice contains natural fruit sugars. Another estrogen related problem with sugar consumption is that, eating too much sugar leads to an increase in stored body fat. Fat cells excrete estrogen. So, the more fat cells that you have sitting around your body, the more estrogen you‚Äôll have floating around as well. This is additional to the estrogen produced by the endocrine system. So, rather than reaching for a sweet sugar saturated treat, do your estrogen levels a favor and opt for foods that are high in proteins, fiber and healthy fats. Our fourth no go food for estrogen is beer. I know, this is a tough one. Now, I‚Äôm not saying you can‚Äôt drink it at all, but if you want to get really lean and maximize your muscle mass and strength, then you gotta‚Äô cut back on the booze.  Here‚Äôs why. As you know beer contains hops. But what are hops? Well, they're actually the female part of the hop plant. They‚Äôre a preservative that has been added to beer for

1375,TJW9ic8,Food for thought: How your belly controls your brain | Ruairi Robertson | TEDxFulbrightSantaMonica,"""Have you ever had a gut feeling or butterflies in your stomach? Has hunger ever changed your mood? Our bellies and brains are physically and biochemically connected in a number of ways, meaning the state of our intestines can alter the way our brains work and behave, giving a whole new meaning to 'Food for thought'. 


As a nutritionist, microbiologist and neuroscientist, Ruairi Robertson is passionate about the link between our bellies and brains. His research is examining how our intestines and the microbes within them can influence both physical and mental health, and most importantly how our diets influence this relationship. Ruairi has travelled the world researching food, and believes it is the key to global public health. Ruairi is a PhD student in University College Cork in Ireland and current Fulbright Scholar (2015/16) to Harvard University.

It turns out it‚Äôs not so simple and some of the most promoted and popular foods can, in fact, harm you. Never eat these 10 dangerous foods for the sake of your own health and the health of your family. 
Even if you see the juice labels ‚Äúnot from concentrate‚Äù or ‚Äú100% pure‚Äù, don't let this fool you. Juice, after being squeezed from different fruits, is kept in huge vacuum-sealed tanks where it can sit for up to a year before being packaged! And by that time, the juice has lost all its flavor, which is why manufacturers have to add artificial flavoring to make it taste fruity again.
In most cases, cereals are loaded with refined carbohydrates and sugar. Even if the label assures you that it's fat-free and whole grain, check the list of ingredients. You'll most likely see that the product is full of sugar.
Despite common belief, most yogurts don't contain probiotic bacteria since the process of pasteurization kills all these microorganisms. 
When consumed, trans-fats in ice-cream can cause high cholesterol, stroke, heart disease, and even cancer. Ice cream is also loaded with sugar, artificial flavors, and synthetic preservatives. And if it‚Äôs pink, purple, or red, it‚Äôs most likely been colored with cochineal extract or carmine, additives which can cause bad allergic reactions. 
Popcorn has some genetically modified ingredients as well as taste-boosting chemicals and additives. This leads to health problems such as heart attacks, digestive issues, allergies, skin rashes, breathing problems, and the depressing list goes on. Even more, popcorn is extremely caloric.

SUMMARY
-Store-bought juices may contain some real fruit, but most of their content is water, sugar, and artificial flavoring.
-Protein bars and energy bars alike are usually processed products containing sugar, artificial flavors and sweeteners.
-Breakfast cereals typically contain a teeny tiny amount of whole grains, which allows producers to mark their product as healthy, but they also contain unhealthy sugar. 
-Margarine is typically made from industrial vegetable oils hydrogenated to become solid, a process that significantly increases the oils‚Äô trans-fat content.
-Manufacturers load ‚Äúlow-fat‚Äù yogurts with sugar to make up for the lack of taste usually provided by the natural fats.
-Instead of pure milk or cream, manufacturers use cheaper hydrogenated fats such as palm- or coconut oil to produce ice-cream. These oils, when heated, become nothing more than trans-fats.
-One egg contains as much cholesterol as a big greasy burger.
-Microwave popcorn‚Äôs almost always lined with the same toxic substance you can find in Teflon pans.
-If candy doesn‚Äôt contain sugar, it contains artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose, and saccharine. These substances are chemically processed and may cause some serious side effects.
-Artificial sweeteners in diet soda can easily lead to weight gain as they trigger the production of insulin, which makes your body store fat.

1396,_qhIT8sOymk,How Long Foods Stay In Your Stomach,"How long does the process of digestion last? Do you find yourself still hungry no matter how much you eat? If so, you might be eating foods that are too high on the glycemic index. It‚Äôs definitely something worth knowing if you‚Äôre struggling with excess weight. 

 The glycemic index is a system of values given to foods according to how quickly they cause an increase in blood glucose levels. To put that in layman‚Äôs terms, it basically measures how fast different foods are digested by the body. Glucose is a simple sugar that gives your body energy, and you get it from the foods you eat.

Your blood is what carries this sugar throughout your body to all your hungry cells and tissues. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called blood glucose. If you eat something that‚Äôs high on the index, your blood glucose will spike, giving you a fast boost of energy.

TIMESTAMPS: 
What glycemic index is 
Foods that digest slowly 
Foods that digest moderately 
Foods that digest quickly  
Foods that don‚Äôt have a glycemic index value 
What about pizza?  
Are all low-glycemic foods healthy? 

Music by Epidemic Sound  

SUMMARY: 
- The glycemic index is a system of values given to foods according to how quickly they cause an increase in blood glucose levels. To put that in layman‚Äôs terms, it basically measures how fast different foods are digested by the body.
- If you eat something that‚Äôs high on the index, your blood glucose will spike, giving you a fast boost of energy.
- Foods and drinks are actually split into three groups: low, medium, and high. Low items rate from 1 to 55, medium is from 56 to 69, and high items are from 70 and above.
- According to the experts at Bodytomy, some low-glycemic foods, like cooked vegetables or a salad, can remain in your stomach anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour.
- There are also foods that really don‚Äôt really have a glycemic index value since they don‚Äôt contain any carbs. But they can still take a while to be digested by your stomach. It can take you anywhere from 2 to 5 hours for your stomach to digest meats, like chicken, lamb, and pork.
- If you‚Äôre having pizza that‚Äôs just dough, cheese, and sauce, that might rate high on the glycemic index, mostly because of that dough. But believe it or not, adding toppings actually makes your slice healthier!
- You might encounter foods that will be low on the index, but if they‚Äôre processed, they most likely still contain tons of saturated fats, sugar, and empty calories.

1403,03vWwqYPf60,Organic food - hype or hope? | DW Documentary,"There is growing demand in the western world for organic food. But do consumers always get what it says on the label? How can authenticity be verified?

Is organic food automatically healthier? Consumers are prepared to pay a significant premium for it. There are currently, however, no reliable tests for distinguishing organic from conventionally produced food. Farmers need to invest a great deal of time, energy and money to qualify as a producer of organic food. There is no proof, however, that organic food actually contains fewer contaminants than conventionally farmed products. There is no such thing as pollution-free food, and there are currently no tests available for reliably distinguishing between organic and non-organic food. That opens doors for lucrative labeling fraud, which in turn explains why there are far more organic eggs on the market at Easter than at any other time of the year. The statistics clearly suggest manipulation, but it is hard to obtain evidence due to the differences between the two production processes appearing to have little effect on the quality of the product. Irish dairy farmers, for instance, are not allowed to label their milk ""organic"" because the pasture land where their herds spend more than 300 days a year are treated with mineral fertilizers. Because cows are themselves bioreactors, however, the milk they yield contains no trace at all of fertilizer. On average, conventional Irish milk contains more omega 3 fatty acids and antioxidants than organic milk from Germany. The reason is the fodder; German organic farms may use only concentrates and silage as supplementary feed to increase milk output - which impacts negatively on the quality of the milk. This documentary looks at researchers who are studying potential ways of reliably distinguishing between organic and conventionally produced food. And that is no easy task. Nearly every foodstuff requires a specific test. But one thing is certain: organic farming makes a major contribution to human welfare - by helping to mitigate climate change, protect the groundwater, conserve nature and promote animal welfare.

We asked people who are learning Dutch which typical Dutch dishes they know, and what they think about the Dutch cuisine (Nederlandse keuken).

What about the eating habits? How does a Dutch meal at dinner look like? Is it always potatoes + meat + a vegetable...? How about lunch... preparing sandwiches at home to take them with you to school or work?

Take 4-5 rounds of brie, cut the tops from brie and wrap in the dough and place the brie ‚Äútower‚Äù in the center of the baking tray. Put jacket potatoes around, spray potatoes with olive oil and add any spicy you like and bake for 60 minutes. Yummy! Another cool idea is to cool camembert with vegetables. Baked camembert with vegetables topping recipe: cut the camembert in half and place one half in the middle of pastry circle, add vegetable topping and potato slices. Cut the pastry in 8 parts, it will look like a flower. Use a glass to cut a circular line at the end of each petal. Fold petals one by one and brush with egg wash. Bake.

1419,lwgXXVXM3I,"Fast food, Fat profits: Obesity in America | Fault Lines","Obesity in America has reached a crisis point. Two out of every three Americans are overweight, one out of every three is obese. One in three are expected to have diabetes by 2050. 

Minorities have been even more profoundly affected. African-Americans have a 50 per cent higher prevalence of obesity and Hispanics 25 per cent higher when compared with whites. 

How did the situation get so out of hand? 

On this week's episode of Fault Lines, Josh Rushing explores the world of cheap food for Americans living at the margins. 

What opportunities do people have to eat healthy? Who is responsible for food deserts and processed food in American schools? 

Fault Lines finds food revolutions taking place and speaks with the people that are fighting back.

1424,Qf5AkskQr1,18 Harmful Foods We Keep Giving to Children,"How to Keep Your Child Healthy. Proper nutrition is super important for your children‚Äôs health and well-being. If you wish them well and don‚Äôt want them to settle for unhealthy food choices that they are likely to repeat as they become older, pay attention to this video. It turns out some common foods we consider healthy are actually really bad for your kids. Here‚Äôs a list the foods that are harmful to children as well as wholesome alternatives. Even milk, juice, yogurt and cereal can be dangerous. 
Junk food is not surprisingly loaded with salt, sugar, and saturated fat. When consumed regularly, this deadly trio could cause obesity, high cholesterol, and cardiovascular diseases. 

TIMESTAMPS
Never give your child juice 
Never feed your child yogurt 
Why cereal is bad for your kid 
Why honey is dangerous for your kid 
Never feed your child grapes 
Avoid children‚Äôs multivitamins 
Why milkshakes are bad for your kid 
Never feed your child fast food 
Why coffee is bad for your kid 
How soda can do your kid harm 
Why processed meats are dangerous for your kid

SUMMARY
-A glass of juice contains 5‚Äì6 teaspoons of sugar. The dissolved sugar immediately gets absorbed into the bloodstream, which is bad for the metabolism of carbohydrates.
-Yogurts with fruit contain a lot of sugar, fat, and calories, which all lead to children becoming overweight. It also increases their risk of getting diabetes.
-Flakes, muesli, and other similar cereals contain is a lot of sugar. All the healthy elements of corn, wheat, and oats are removed during production ‚Äî only the carbohydrates are left.
-Honey can cause an allergic reaction, and sometimes honey contains bacteria, which can lead to a serious infectious disease called botulism.
-Grapes are large and slippery, and a child could choke on them. Grapes are also very difficult for a child‚Äôs digestive tract to process.
-No matter how harmless animal-shaped vitamins look, they should only be prescribed by doctors.
-Drinking fatty milkshakes regularly can lead to the development of cardiovascular diseases.
-French fries, burgers, and pizza are loaded with salt, sugar, and saturated fat. When consumed regularly, this deadly trio could cause obesity, high cholesterol, and cardiovascular diseases.
-Caffeine, which is an ingredient in coffee, could affect calcium absorption, and this might weaken their bones.
-Soda contains calories, artificial sweeteners, and caffeine, all of which erode tooth enamel and cause mood swings.
-Processed meats like hot dogs, bacon, and bologna are rich in sodium and saturated fat. However, when consumed daily and in large amounts, they may increase the risk of heart disease, diabetes, high cholesterol, and spikes in blood pressure.
-Chicken nuggets must go because they‚Äôre packed with preservatives, calories, salt, and a bit of sugar. 
-Potato chips contain loads of sodium and fat. Chips should never land in your grocery basket, and they should stay out of your child‚Äôs life as well.
-Ketchup is made from sugar, corn syrup, food coloring, and extra fat.
-Mac and cheese contains sodium, food preservatives, and noodles stripped of fiber. This same goes for canned spaghetti and ramen in plastic packages. 
-Canned tuna contains high levels of mercury, which is dangerous for their health.
-Cake, cookies, doughnuts, candies, and fruit snacks can cause tooth decay and cavities.
-According to the FDA, unpasteurized milk carries dangerous bacteria such as salmonella, E. coli, and listeria.

1425,4rrqc3Skwr8,22 CRAZY FOOD HACKS YOU HAVE TO TRY,"DELICIOUS DISHES FOR A PARTY
We love candies and share a lot of ideas you can make using sweets. If you want to amaze your guests try to cook dishes we share! Make a cool decoration for a cake made from pears and candies. You can create a perfect flower that looks real. Make a huge lollipop with candies inside. It will be a perfect gift for kids. Decorate a cupcake with a flower made from lollipop and marshmallow. It will be a super cute flower for your candy bar. 
Another awesome idea is to make a lollipop out of sprite! Take a bowl a pour sprite, add food coloring and gelatin. Pour the mix into a mold for lollipops and freeze.  
Do you want to cook something special for your home party? The recipe of black ice-cream: take a bowl and add heavy cream, sugar and activated charcoal. Beat the mixture and add dry rice. And mix again. This perfect dessert will amaze your friends! Moreover, we have one more cool idea to surprise your friends - vegan caviar. Take a pan and pour water into it, add sriracha and agar-agar and mix these ingredients. Simmer agar-agar and sriracha for two minutes. Take a tall glass and pour vegetable oil, put into the fridge and let cool. When the vegetable oil is cold, take a syringe and squeeze out spheres of the hot mixture into the cold oil. You will see bead shapes appearing that will sink to the bottom of the glass. To separate the oil from pearls wash them with some water. Now you have fake caviar to decorate a cake or everything you like!
Camembert bread will be the best dish during your party. Cut off the top of the bread loaf, make a hole large enough to fit the camembert. Next, cut the top of camembert and place into the hole. Make incisions on bread and fill with the sauce (mix rosemary, garlic, and olive oil). Bake for 25 minutes. Yummy!

TEDxTeen opening music by BlackDoe

Rob is an adventurer, activist, and dude making a difference. His purpose is to inspire health, happiness, and freedom on Earth and he‚Äôs dedicated his life to this mission. He has cycled across the United States, twice, on a bamboo bicycle, went 1,000 days without showering, and has dove into thousands of dumpsters across America, all to inspire positive social and environmental change. When not out adventuring he lives off the grid in a fifty-square-foot tiny home in San Diego. His extreme adventures and activism campaigns may appear unattainable at first glance but within them are an abundance of simple lessons and tips that can be adapted into any life to live with more happiness, health, and freedom.

Just to be clear, this video is not sponsored or endorsed by any of the restaurants depicted, or any other company. This was in fact a hidden camera expos√©, and no foods were tampered with in any way.  They were all served to me exactly as they appear in the video. 

And in case you're wondering what I did with all of this food, my cameraman ate some of it and I gave the rest to the workers who were painting my next door neighbor's house.

1465,P2BVyHOdFU,You Can't Reheat Some Foods Under Any Circumstances,"Is it safe to microwave your food? Let's imagine you went out to dinner last night. Chances are you brought home the leftovers and they‚Äôre sitting in your fridge right now. But before you break out the styrofoam carton, pop it in the microwave, and chow down, you should know that there are some foods that actually turn poisonous when reheated! 

No matter how tasty and healthy your freshly prepared meal is, it can lose its health benefits and even cause food poisoning if you reheat it in a microwave. Bright Side introduces to you a list of foods that you should eat as soon as they‚Äôre cooked.

Chicken and processed meat 
Potatoes 
Celery, spinach, and beets 

  

Music by Epidemic Sound   

SUMMARY:
- Whether they‚Äôre in a soup or stir-fry, reheating mushrooms in the microwave or on the stove is a big no-no. The change in composition can cause you to have an upset stomach, and they also lose their health benefits.
- Similarly to mushrooms, eggs are packed with protein that changes once it‚Äôs reheated. This can wreak havoc on your digestive system. In fact, eggs can become toxic when exposed to a microwave‚Äôs high temperatures.
- Even if the rice is cooked, boiling water won‚Äôt kill the bacteria. After the rice cools off to room temperature, its bacteria spores can multiply, and reheating it just keeps the bacteria alive. The longer it sat at room temperature, the more likely it is to contain harmful bacteria.
- When it‚Äôs time to reheat the breast milk, you should never heat it in a microwave because the uneven distribution of heat can create hot spots in the milk, which can seriously burn the poor baby who drinks it.
- Just like mushrooms, reheating chicken can change the food‚Äôs protein compounds and make you very sick. Unlike other meat (like beef), chicken contains a high amount of protein, which makes reheating it in the microwave a bad idea.
-  If you place cooked potatoes directly into the fridge after cooking them, it‚Äôs probably safe to reheat them. However, if they sit out at room temperature for a while after they‚Äôre prepared, they‚Äôre more likely to develop a rare bacteria known as botulism. 
- While nitrites are dangerous for adults, they‚Äôre incredibly dangerous for infants from 0 to 6 months. If they do ingest food with nitrites, they are more likely to develop ‚Äúblue baby syndrome,‚Äù which can be fatal.
- Before you stick a leftover sandwich in the microwave, don‚Äôt forget to remove any toothpicks the restaurant may have stuck in there! Along with items with sharp tips, metal is a big no-no when it comes to microwave cooking.

1467,Y81rCiw1LPY,Food betrayal -- don‚Äôt swallow the lies | Alan Lewis | TEDxBoulder,"This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. As an industry insider, Alan Lewis knows just how badly the food system is broken. In this high energy TEDx talk, Alan reveals the sophisticated methods used by the food industry ‚Äúfibberati‚Äù to manipulate, deceive and distract us. If you have ever read a food label and felt you were being lied to, you have felt the ‚Äúdark mark‚Äù of the fibberati.  We can resist these nefarious tactics by making conscious food choices based on core values that support a sustainable and just food system.

Alan directs Government Affairs and Food and Agriculture Policy for Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage, a 60-year-old health food chain operating over 85 stores in fifteen states. He is active in many trade organizations and sits on the Boulder County Food and Agriculture Policy Council. His focus is on communicating with local and federal policy makers using frameworks that are non-confrontational and inclusive -- except for tonight. He has lived for extended periods in Portugal, Haiti, and Dominica, where he developed a keen appreciation for the variables of agriculture production and food systems within different geographic, cultural and economic contexts. 

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",Food

1471,3n8gZvEew9g,"8 Popular Foods We Don't Eat Anymore, Here's Why","What foods do you buy daily? How about SunnyD? Or maybe congealed salad is the thing you can't live without? Yup, these foods are so unpopular now! However, just 20‚Äì40 years ago they were flying off the grocery store shelves!

Hi-C 
Bubble Tape 
Ambrosia Salad 
Crisco 
Cottage Cheese 

Music by Epidemic Sound   

SUMMARY:
- TV dinners first stepped onto the scene in the 1950s when Swanson was looking for a way to sell their Thanksgiving food leftovers. They came up with the idea of serving ready-made food frozen on a convenient tray.
- If you ever ate dinner at your grandma‚Äôs house as a kid, you probably tasted the stuff once or twice. Gelatin was first used in dishes back in medieval Europe and was partly made from the collagen in animal bones.
- Back in 1968, many kids could be seen sipping on a cold bottle of SunnyD as a part of a well-balanced breakfast ‚Äî and it was anything but. SunnyD tasted super sweet because it was primarily made of corn syrup and contained less than 5% juice. 
- One Hi-C Wild Cherry juice box contained a whopping 27 g of sugar, which is more than the American Heart Association recommends grown women ingest in a day ‚Äî and these were intended for kids! 
- Back in the late ‚Äô80s and ‚Äò90s, Bubble Tape was a fan fave! But ever, since sugar-free gum became more popular and oral health, became more of a priority, this sugary sweet gum just wasn‚Äôt as desirable anymore.
- Ambrosia salad was usually found at family gatherings back when you or your parents were younger. This sweet salad actually came onto the scene back in the 1800s and usually featured special sweet treats that only appeared on special occasions. 
- Once people realized how bad trans fats were for them during the ‚Äò90s, Crisco stopped being used as often.
- It wasn‚Äôt until the 1950s that cottage cheese became incredibly popular. It‚Äôs very mild in flavor and isn‚Äôt super high in fat, which was appealing to people from the ‚Äò50s into the ‚Äò70s.

In today's video we highlight a list of vegetables, fruits, herbs and spices which have little to no carbs and no sugar. These are practical when on a no sugar diet, or low carb diet such as the ketogenic or carnivore diet. High amounts of sugar taken regularly will cause damage to the body and chronic inflammation over time. Reducing these and eating healthier sources of vitamins and minerals will help your body to get back into sync and heal itself naturally.

""Let thy Food be thy Medicine and thy Medicine be thy Food."" -- Hippocrates

That's the message from the founding father of modern medicine echoed in the controversial new documentary film 'Food Matters' from first-
time Producer-Directors James Colqhuoun and Laurentine ten Bosch.

""With nutritionally-depleted foods, chemical additives and ourtendency to rely upon pharmaceutical drugs to treat what's wrong with
our malnourished bodies, it's no wonder that modern society is getting sicker. 'Food Matters' sets about uncovering the trillion dollar
worldwide ""Sickness Industry"" and giving people some scientifically verifiable solutions for curing disease naturally."" - James

And in what promises to be the most contentious idea put forward, the filmmakers have interviewed several world leaders in nutrition and natural healing who claim that not only are we harming our bodies with improper nutrition, but that the right kind of foods, supplements and detoxification can be used to treat chronic illnesses as fatal as terminally diagnosed cancer.

'Food Matters' is to be launched globally via the internet using full screen video technology.

Lyrics:

Intro (spoken)

Yo man...
Yo I know you see me here dude!!
I've been waiting here like 10 minutes, man!
No, no no... this is MY parking space man.
What you need to do is put your little hybrid in reverse, 
And go out the way you came in.
WHAT?!?!
Yo its about to get REAL in the Whole Foods parking lot man...

Chorus  (with feeling)

It's getting' REAL in the Whole Foods Parking Lot
I got my STEEL and you know it gets sparked a lot
Im on my grind homie... It's on my mind homie!
These fools with clip boards are lookin' at me like they know me!

It's getting' REAL in the Whole Foods Parking Lot
You know the DEAL with the little shopping carts they got...
Check out what I say, it happens every day...
It's how we LIVE on the west side of LA!!

Verse 1

... Im ridin' slow in my Prius...
all leather, tinted windows... you cant see us!!
Everybody's trying to park, you can feel the tension
I'm in electric mode... can't even hear the engine (Shhhhhhh)

Just then I saw a spot open up, 
My timings perfect... Im creepin' up...
But then this other dude tried to steal it going the wrong way
Yo man, I've had a LONG DAY!

Chorus 
(same as before)

Verse 2

Now I'm on this inside, looking at my list
Organic chicken, Kale Salad and a Lemon Twist.
Some girl in yoga pants is lookin at me funny
I'm just trying to find a decent Pinot Noir for under twenty!

Then I take it to the cheese counter, Humboldt Fog?
We just ran out sir!  Really Dog?
Take it easy man, I try to calm myself...
I've been on edge ever since they took Kombucha off the shelf...

Chorus

(same as before)

Verse 3

This Busters on his iPhone talking to his friends, 
Picking up some cayenne pepper for his master cleanse.
You're the most annoying dude I've ever SEEN brah... 
Could you PLEASE move?  You're RIGHT in front of the Quinoa.

Damn, I'm about to check out.
Pay my 80 bucks for 6 things and get the heck out.
The express lane is moving hella slow...
Man, these fools don't know... that shit is getting REAL....

Chorus
(same as before)

1486,RwZY1jaw2EM,Food Matters (PART 1) - First 8 Minutes,"Dear Friend,

What you're about to learn could likely save your life, or that of someone you love. This was certainly the case with my Father. 

About 6 years ago my Father was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Depression and Anxiety. The best the medical profession could offer was a cocktail of medications to treat the symptoms and little in the way of hope for treating the underlying causes. Not surprisingly his health continued to decline.

At the same time we were studying nutrition and sending my father many books we had read but these didn't seem to help convince him. So for the next 12 months (with 3 years of research up our sleeves) we set about creating the independent documentary film 'Food Matters'.

'Food Matters' features interviews with leading health experts who reveal the best natural healing choices you can make for you and your family's health. In the film you'll discover what works, what doesn't and what's killing you.

Needless to say after my father saw the film he quit his pharmaceutical meds, changed his diet, lost 20% of his body weight and is now running 3 times a week which is a big change from being bed ridden for 5 years!

Thank you for your support in helping this lifesaving information reach more people, it would not be possible without you.

James Colquhoun & Laurentine ten Bosch

Producer / Directors 'Food Matters'

PS: You don't have to take our word for it, here is what others are saying about the film.  

""Everything I have been harping on for the last 40 years, these two have brilliantly encapsulated in one beautifully produced, eminently watchable video."" - Harvey Diamond, Author of America's best selling health book 'Fit For Life'

""This film lays out the inconvenient truth the food industry doesn't want you to hear -- that nearly all degenerative disease is actually caused by the processed, nutrient-depleted food being consumed in first-world nations around the world. 'Food Matters' dares to reveal how we can stop this cycle of destruction and restore true health to ourselves and our planet."" - Mike Adams founder of Natural News.com


 ""Anyone who is serious about their health needs to see this stunning film.""
- Christiane Northrup, MD, author of the Women's Wisdom series


 ""James and Laurentine provide a radiant beacon of hope with steps you can do today to take control of your health and begin healing.

Is it worth the waiting for,
If we live till eighty-four
All we ever get is gruel,
Every day we say our prayers
Will they change the bill of fair?
Still we get the same old gruel
There's not a crust not a crumb
Can we find can we beg can we borrow or cadge,
But there's nothing to stop us from getting a thrill,
When we all close our eyes and imagine,

Food glorious food
Hot sausage and mustard
While we're in the mood cold jelly and custard
Pease pudding and saveloys
What next is the question?
Rich gentlemen have it boys
IN-DI-GESTION

Food glorious food
What is there more handsome
Gulped swallowed or chewed
Still worth a kings ransom
What is it we dream about?
What brings on a sigh?
Piled peaches and cream about six feet high

1503,QygPpMeXEV,Making Global Research Connections Through Food,"For many faculty members, summer is an especially important time for research. For some scholars in fields such as anthropology and linguistics, research is conducted living and working among people in different communities. Sometimes those communities are close to home, and other times far away from the University of Rochester, both geographically and culturally. 

Researchers such as Timothy Dye‚Äîa medical anthropologist and social epidemiologist at the Medical Center with an appointment in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology‚Äîand Nadine Grimm, an assistant professor of linguistics who specializes in African languages‚Äîhave conducted field research in remote communities where a key component of their work is gaining the trust of the people there. 

There are many dimensions to gaining that trust, but among the most basic involves the sharing of food.
 
Dye recalls his first real-life lesson in the importance of eating local foods while working in remote communities. He was in the Kashmir region of the Himalayas about 30 years ago conducting surveys about diarrhea in the village children. After entering the first house, he turned on his tape recorder and began asking family members questions about their beliefs about the causes of the diarrhea and their treatments. But the interview was not going particularly well.

‚ÄúA woman ladled some chai into a metal cup and handed it to me. Sanitation was a huge issue in the village, so naturally I wondered about the milk and water that were mixed into the tea,‚Äù says Dye. ‚ÄúBut I remembered a basic rule about doing field research in anthropology, which requires us to accept any offering of food or drink, lest we offend someone and risk an entire research project.‚Äù

Dye drank‚Äîthen gulped‚Äîthe warm tea, which he found to be rich and creamy, as well as satisfying in the cold, high-altitude environment. At that point, everyone broke into a more natural conversation, leaving the research questions for another‚Äîand more successful‚Äîday.

""For some communities, eating certain foods means that you're a part of that nationality,"" says Dye. ""If you drink chang, a type of homemade beer in Tibet, it's said you're Tibetan.""
 
Depending on where he is working, Dye‚Äôs diet has included, in addition to chang, snakes, wildebeests, insects, giraffes, and bats. 

Nadine Grimm, who has studied languages in remote areas of South America and Africa, has enjoyed a similarly wide palette, which has included, for example, monkey and python.
 
""Eating local foods makes it easier to connect with indigenous communities,"" she says. ""Once they offer me food, I feel accepted, which makes it easier to do my research.""

It isn't just the culinary choices that are different in these remote communities; it's also the attitudes some cultures have toward food‚Äîand that includes the Bagyeli Pygmies, who are hunter/gatherers. 
 
""For the Bagyeli Pygmies, the entire day is preoccupied with how they'll get food,"" says Grimm. ""Sometimes they're unlucky and don't have enough food for themselves, let alone for a guest, which is why I stay in a nearby town and limit my meals with them.""
 
Because the availability of food varies greatly with the Bagyeli, dining with the community takes on added significance. ""They gradually offered me better food items, she says, ‚Äústarting with steamed bread fruit and working their way up to wild meat."" 

‚ÄúEating local‚Äù in much of the United States is, of course, a trend more often than a necessity. It‚Äôs a trend that‚Äôs captured the interest of many college students, including at Rochester. 
 
This past semester, Dye and Grimm shared with undergraduate students some of their thoughts and experiences about eating locally‚Äîglobally‚Äîover a cooking and eating demonstration incorporating a couple of their favorite foods from Tibet and from Swahili-speaking regions of Africa. 

With increasing numbers of students coming to the University of Rochester from outside the United States, it's not uncommon to break bread with people from a variety of cultures that diverge widely from typical American traditions. For the students who took part in this cooking demonstration, it's just one more chance to broaden their perspective, and their palette.

VANDANA SHIVA:
""Once they have established the norm --

that seed can be owned as their property --

royalties can be collected.

We will depend on them

for every seed we grow

of every crop we grow.

If they control seed, they control food, they know it; it's strategic.

It's more powerful than bombs.

It's more powerful than guns.

This is the best way to control the populations of the world.""

CHORUS:
That's what the streets them say.

That's what police them say.

That's what the Babylon say.

Put cola upon lips

and get popped the same way now.

That's what The Pentagon say.

That's what the generals say.

That's what the empire say.

Put death down your throat,

you get dropped the same way.

SEASUNZ:

There's a war going on inside,

no man is safe from:

DDTs, PCBs,

every corner in the hood got a KFC

or McD's. It's crack speed like RED

Bull-ish they pulpit -- so caffeine,

Kit Kat like a click-clack holes in your genes

Cuz everything at market ain't all what it seems.

Little Debbie bussing biscuits at sugar-high fiends.

Ain't nothing but a G thing --

GMO, MSG, genocide of street gangs.

Aspartame or street cane.

Monsanto is Rambo.

Round Up with ammo.

Who would have known you can die from a diet

Diabetes and the -itis from the dairy and the dose

of the high fructose

cuz your ribs too close

so you might start a riot.

Might be a FOOD FIGHTER!

CHORUS REPEATED

SEASUNZ:

They shootin'!

Made you look

at the labels on the food that you cook.

Just say no to cocoa box

cuz when you Google the ingredients, you might get got.

Is your milk on drugs? Cuz your brain on Fox.

Factory farming spawning the Meatrix plot,

Globally warming us all, enough cows and NOx

driving the climate, driving a hummer or not.

Drive-in like a drive-by.

E.coli served super sized with a side of super lies.

so tell me what's more gangsta than that?

Bullets or burgers both blaze burners to black.

Breakfast is a little like Texas,

Petro is everything that you're eating on

My pesto is backyard like choppin' chard.

My school lunch pack a punch.

FOOD FIGHT IS ON!

CHORUS REPEATED

STIC.MAN:

What's Beef?

Beef is when you're 12 years old and obese

clogged arteries, can't see your own feet

until you're up in ICU, guaranteed to be an 'I see you""

From that processed food.

Suicide. It's a suicide.

Don't want no microwaves, no pesticides.

Fast food's a slow death in disguise.

It's the wild wild westernized world of deception and lies.

What's Beef?

Beef is when you starve in a famine.

Nothing won't grow and the land stays barren.

Pollution in the river, mercury in the salmon.

What sense do it make, being at war with the planet?

We're at war for the mind so impressionable.

Instead of vegetables,

we reach for Red Bulls.

Poor diets kill more brothers than pistols.

We're fighting for our lives like Michael Vic's pit bulls.

Dog eat dog, America eats the young,

We die from beef, but more from meat than the gun.

Bullets for breakfast and mass murder meals.

Enemy of the state, and your plate is the battlefield

1510,KoUcEcz1dM,8 Foods that Are Actually Damaging Your Kidneys,"Have you ever noticed that final powerful spray of water at the carwash before your vehicle gets a rapid blow dry? The water jets pulverize any remaining remnants of dirt.

That‚Äôs one way to view how our kidneys work. Their job is to flush out toxins from the blood by way of urine. The National Institutes of Health reports that our kidneys filter an excess of 200 quarts of blood daily. That translates into 2 quarts of waste each day. They don‚Äôt get holidays or weekends off; they work day and night.

Thankfully, our kidneys can wash away impurities while retaining vital nutrients floating around in our blood. Keeping our internal filters healthy and functioning properly is invaluable for nourishment and detoxification of our bodies. 

So naturally, whatever we eat and drink has a dramatic impact on our kidneys‚Äô health. A steady diet of unhealthy food and drinks can strain their performance, and put us at risk.

The good news is, it‚Äôs never too late to improve your diet and lifestyle, even if your kidneys are already impaired.
 
In today‚Äôs video we will see how our kidneys react to too much consumption of 8 different foods and beverages.

1. Red meat
We‚Äôve all heard that protein is good for our health. But too much of anything can be harmful. For example, a diet that is high in red meat, which contains lots of animal protein, can damage our kidneys. The reason? Our kidneys need to metabolism this protein. 

When there‚Äôs a conveyor belt of rich protein headed toward the kidneys for cleansing, they  just can‚Äôt keep up with the pace. When kidneys can‚Äôt eliminate waste products, there will be a build-up of acidic residue in our body.
It‚Äôs always good to talk to your health care professional about the diet that‚Äôs right for you.

2.  Alcohol
Just like eating too much red meat can strain our kidneys, the same is true with too much alcohol; they will be unable to properly filter our blood. Also, too much alcohol can cause dehydration. This creates a domino effect: if our blood is dehydrated, our cells and organs will not be able to function properly.

3. Table Salt
While our bodies require sodium to maintain proper fluid balance ‚Äì especially in our electrolytes - an excess amount will cause kidneys to retain water. Too much salt can also increase the amount of protein that is eliminated in urine.

4. Caffeine
Caffeine is a stimulant which millions of people depend upon every morning to help them become fully awake. But all of that caffeine in coffee, tea and sodas can jolt your kidneys into overdrive. The stimulant accelerates blood flow, which in turn increases blood pressure.

Caffeine has another effect ‚Äì it can lead to dehydration, just as salt can. Too much dehydration can lead to kidney stones. Most health experts recommend you drink no more than 2 cups of coffee or 3 cups of tea daily. Soda and energy drinks are beverages you may want to eliminate completely. Another source of caffeine is cocoa, which should also be consumed moderately.

5. Artificial Sweeteners
Refined sugar has had a bad rap lately. That‚Äôs why companies began creating artificial sweeteners. It may sound better for our health, but they can still negatively impact kidney function. Try instead to steer away from artificial sweeteners and use stevia or honey to flavor your food and beverages.

6. Dairy Products
While dairy products are an excellent source of protein, they should be consumed in moderation, especially for anyone who has kidney disease. The reason?  Too many dairy products will increase calcium in urine which can lead to kidney stones. Also, as kidneys are overworked, they won‚Äôt be able to regulate protein waste and it will rise to an unhealthy level.

7. Carbonated Beverages
Sodas and energy drinks are usually the chief instigator for kidney problems; they are loaded with caffeine, sugar or artificial sweeteners. They may taste better than thirst-quenching water or lemon water but they aren‚Äôt providing any health benefits for your kidneys.  
 
8. Genetically Modified Foods (GMOs)
In recent years, crops have been the recipient of various forms of herbicides and pesticides. This includes everything from strawberries to rice.

LYRICS:
I ºll start with a taco, soft like a cloud 
I want mine crunchy, I like to eat loud. 
I ºll choose a chalupa, I ºll grab a gordita, 
and two taco salads for our senoritas. 
And a Burrito Supreme, with extra sour cream 
It ºs a cylindrically shaped seasoned beef dream. 
A taquito. An enchirito. Some cinnamon twists. 
A chicken border bowl.  Are you gettin º all this? 

And you know that nothing beats a

We ºll take two of those, but please hold the diced tomatoes. 
And I admit, I ºve always felt, 
like I ºm in love with the meximelt. 
Make mine with a little extra love, and think of me... 
as the cheese drops from your Taco Bell glove. 
 and that ºs it.  

No! I ºm not done...I ºll also take a... 

Double-decker taco cause I ºm feeling wild 
And make my sauce Fire. Uh, he ºll take mild. 
and we ºll take two Mt. Dew Baja blasts 
for a chance at 25 dollars cash 
I ºm told there ºs a winner for every 5 minutes 
I ºm stealing your online code if you win it. 
Why would you do that? You owe me 25 bones 
I owe you 5.  Plus interest--it was a loan. 
And I think we ºll be satisÔ¨Åed, if we get some mexican rice on the side.

In this video we use survival skills to catch fish. We caught a lot of fish. Initially we went looking for fish, I met a pond with a lot of fish. We covered the banks and took all the water in the pond to catch fish. We use the primitive technology to make a bucket of water. We caught very large fish and lots of small fish. Then we dropped into the fish pond that we just built. The fish pond that we just built is a place to store food.

Do you know WHAT you are eating? You may think you are eating 100% pure food, but the answers is alarmingly different. Take the fast food restaurant Subway for example. Their chicken only contained 50% real chicken. The rest was soy fillers. But soy fillers are not too bad compared to fake eggs. In 2012, scammers in China produced eggs cheaper than the supermarket by creating a mold where they combined resin, starch, coagulant, and pigments. Talk about fake food! But wait there‚Äôs more! Also in China, a gang of traders bought a whole bunch of rat, fox, and minx flesh and sold it as lamb! Check out the rest of these 25 insane food scandals that actually happened.

1520,L4KRCY3h4gA,Top 12 Super Foods That Fight Breast Cancer,"Breast cancer is a disease caused by our bodies cellular unbalance. It‚Äôs most commonly found in women.

Early diagnosis is the best way to effectively treat breast cancer, so getting an annual mammogram is one of the best ways for women over 40 to prevent this disease.

Aside from early diagnosis, keeping your cells balanced and free of harmful free radicals is the second best way to avoid this disease.

So, here is a list of foods that contain chemical compounds that help slow the development of cancer.

Green Tea

Green tea is rich in polyphenols and catechins. These substances are antioxidants that protect our cells from DNA damage caused by free radicals. One cup of green tea per day is the recommended amount.

Pomegranate juice

Pomegranate juice also contains polyphenols. According to recent studies, pomegranate juice has the potential to be a preventative tool for certain types of cancer, including breast cancer. 

Blueberries, strawberries and black raspberries

These fruits contain large quantities of polyphenols, that may contain anticancer properties. Furthermore, they are rich in antioxidants, such as vitamin C. You should eat from ¬æ of a cup to 1 cup of fruit a day. 

Plums and peaches

Studies indicate that the polyphenols found in plums and peaches can help prevent breast cancer cell formation and keep them from multiplying. 
Evidence suggest that polyphenols help kill cancerous cells, without harming healthy cells.

Cruciferous vegetables
These vegetables are normally rich in antioxidants (such as vitamins C, E and K) and fiber. The most popular cruciferous vegetables are:

- Broccoli;
- Cauliflower;
- Brussel sprouts;
- Arugula;
- Cabbage. 

Green vegetables

The greener the vegetable, the denser the nutrients. Green vegetables are normally rich in antioxidants and fibers, which makes them valuable tools against cancer.

Carotenoids

Carotenoids are found in red, orange, dark green and yellow fruits and vegetables. These foods are very rich in vitamin A, lutein, beta carotene and lycopene, all of which are effective against free radicals. 

Apigenin

Apigenin is a flavonoid found in certain fruits, vegetables and herbs. As apigenin is an antioxidant, these foods may have anti-inflammatory properties as well.

The most common sources of apignenin are:
- Parsley; 
- Celery; 
- Chamomile; 
- Mint; 
- Spinach; 
- Licorice. 

Omega-3 Fatty Acids 

Found abundantly in cold water fish, omega-3 fatty acids are an essential nutrient for the functioning of your immune system.

The most common sources of Omega-3 are:

- Salmon; 
- Sardines; 
- Herring; 
- Fish oils, such as cod liver oil. 

Whole grains

Whole foods also tend to be high in anticancer polyphenols, they usually include other essential nutrients such as fiber, magnesium and protein.

Some examples of whole grains are:

- Brown rice;
- Oats;
- Corn;
- Barley. 

Peppers 

Both dehydrated and fresh peppers contain capsaicin. This component is a very powerful antioxidant in the fight against free radicals and it also has anticancer power. The hotter the pepper, the higher the concentration of capsaicin.

Garlic

Garlic is especially effective for people suffering from breast cancer that have a reaction with estrogen. 

Saffron
Saffron has curcumin that helps decrease the toxic effects of certain breast cancer cells and can inhibit the growth of cancer cells.

Always remember that breast cancer treatment should be overseen by a doctor, however, these tips may help to complement it, so talk to your doctor about these foods.

Our travel and food in sikkim was fun, had great time in Gangtok...If you have any experience of Gangtok in terms of sightseeing or food, do share that in comments below‚Ä¶

Travelling cost:  Refer to EP 1 description section on how below cost is calculated.

Min cost to reach Gangtok: Rs 500.
Hotel: Rs 1500 per day.
Food Rs 500 one meal
Total cost of Day 0: Rs 2500

Day1 : Cab for local sightseeing  for 8 hours Rs 2500.
You may want to take share cab for point to point travelling but then you can't travel to all tourist destinations. 

Example from MG marg you can take a share cab for trolley point by paying Rs 20.. but you can't go to Hanuman Tok on share cab as on that route no share cab.,

OLA and uber taxi service not available.

you : can take cab for travelling from one point to another , but that's expensive they charge anything from Rs 200 to Rs 400...

Day 1 : 
cab : 2500
food 1000
hotel: 1500
Total cost of Day 1: Rs 5000.
Above cost will apply for Day 0 and Day 1 will be 2500 plus 5000 equals to 7500.

I paid much higher cost because i had exclusive taxi all the time, i stayed in 3 category hotel which was expensive.

Rescuers Discover The Heartbreaking Reason This Cat Only Accepts Food In Bags
Homeless cat only accepts food in bags so she can feed her only kitten

Life on the streets isn‚Äôt easy for cats. While house cats enjoy a pampered existence, strays forced to live in the elements struggle every single day to survive.

If you‚Äôve ever fed a stray cat, then you know just how rough life can be for them‚Äîand how appreciative they are of free meals. While they might be wary of people, if there is food to offer, strays will scarf it all down as quickly as they can before bounding off to safety.

That‚Äôs what makes this story so special. When a volunteer from a local animal shelter noticed the strange way one cat was eating food, she decided to follow her. What she discovered changed the way she saw every animal around her‚Ä¶

Closed captioning is available in English, Chinese, German, Hindi, Italian, Khmer, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, Russian, Tagalog, Thai, and Vietnamese. 

[Transcript:]

Hello, my name is Chris Bernstein, and I am the Director of Food Safety Education at the US Department of Agriculture. I'm here today to talk to you about food safety for returning home after a disaster. 

Coming back home after a disaster can be a very challenging experience. One of the most important things you and your family will have to do is sort through the food in your refrigerator, freezer, and pantry. 

You will need to throw away any food that has come into contact with flood water. This includes anything that is not in a waterproof container. Do not use food containers that have caps, snap lips, or pull tops that have come in contact with flood water. Any cardboard boxed food (such as macaroni and cheese, dry pasta, baby formula) contaminated with flood water is not safe to eat and should be tossed. 

Inspect all canned food to see if there is any swelling, leaking, holes, dents, or rust. Canned food can be saved and used to eat only if you do the following things:

- Remove the label off the can. 

- Brush or wipe away any dirt.

- Thoroughly wash the can with soap and water (hot water if available). Use water that is safe for drinking to rinse off the can. 

- Sanitize the can by immersion in either one of two ways:
o Put the can in a clean pot full of water and bring to a complete boil for 2 minutes; or
o Put the can in a clean pot full of clean drinking water and add one tablespoon of unscented liquid chlorine bleach per gallon of water used. Soak can in pot for 15 minutes.

- Let can air-dry for at least one hour before opening or storing can. 

- Write with a permanent marker on the can what is inside and the expiration date (if available). 

- Canned food items should be used as soon as possible after cleaning. 

You will also need to clean your pots, pans, dishes, and utensils by thoroughly washing them with soap and water (hot water if available). 

- Rinse and sanitize them by boiling them in clean water or immersing them in clean drinking water and add one tablespoon of unscented liquid chlorine bleach per gallon of water used. 

- Soak in water for 15 minutes.

Your drinking water may not be safe to drink when you come home after a disaster. You may need to use bottled water or boiled water. If you do not have bottled water, boil the water for one minute before letting it cool down. Store the water in clean containers with lids. 

If you are not able to boil water, you can disinfect it by using household bleach. This will help to kill most organisms in the water that might cause diseases. Add 8 drops (or 1/8 teaspoon) of regular, unscented liquid household bleach for each gallon of water to disinfect your water. Leave water alone for 30 minutes. Store the water in clean containers with lids. 

These safety tips should help you figure out what food you can save or have to throw away, how to clean your pots, pans, dishes, and how to make sure that your water is safe to drink. For more information on food safety, visit USDA‚Äôs website at www.fsis.usda.gov.

Eating enough food is the biggest when it comes to putting on weight as a skinny guy.

For a little while, I stopped focusing on this one critical factor and noticed it was significantly harder to get enough food in.

When I started prioritizing food first thing in the morning, it became much easier to eat enough food.

The longer you delay putting food in you, the smaller your ""eating window"" for the day is.

If you wake up at 6:45am and start eating at 9am versus 7am you've lost 2 hours off your eating window.

Those 2 hours are a great opportunity to take in 500-800 calories and start your day off with a bang!

I appreciate your comments and concerns and once again want to clarify that i undertook this small project, researching reputable sites, and acknowledged that i am not medically trained.  I can however say that many diabetics suffer their diabetes differently.  My husband WAS a Type 2 Diabetic but due to calorie control, cutting back on high processed carbs/sugars and a little bit of walking has managed after 10 years to come off his insulin and is now classified by his specialist as a NON DIABETIC.  Many of you are pushing alternative treatments, selling products etc that I do not and cannot recommend through this YouTube clip.  Please respect each other's views and use this clip as a guide and not as gospel.  Do some research of your own and take control of your health.  All the best. Liz :)",Food

1589,PqR7wtOtyzM,10 Foods Made in China You Must Avoid... The number 6 is not so good! üò±,"10 Foods Made in China You Must Avoid (Filled with Plastic and Cancer Causing Chemicals)

China is well known for its great cuisine and specific taste as well as many different products we use daily. Chinese restaurants are spread all around the globe and it is slowly creating a cult of the Chinese culture. However, lately there are some rumors about lack of standards in Chinese products and people slowly start to avoid importing Chinese goods and is very easy to understand why.

Another thing which is China known for are its fake, cheap products sold all around the world via Amazon, eBay, AliExpress and many more online websites. These products are very cheap and lack quality. They often contain prohibited toxic substances and are fake. These online sites offer food shipped directly from the country.

1590,guxledYcXcE,Processed Food Documentary - Processed Food vs. Nutritional Needs,"Processed Food Documentary: Processed Food vs. Nutritional Needs.

The human body runs on food.  Once, food shortage was the major concern.  After the second world war, technological advances in food production led to a new era, that was characterized by an overabundance of inexpensive food, and relatively little physical activity.  In the decades that followed, other sociocultural shifts continued to contribute to the changing way we ate.  Women who had previously controlled most of the average family's food preparation now entered the workforce in significant numbers.  And the processed food industry began to capitalize on our need for fast, convenient food.  

This meant that fewer meals were being cooked at home.  And since convenience foods were generally higher in calories than home-cooked meals, the average person's caloric intake increased dramatically.

Maya Adam, MD, is waging a battle cry against one of America‚Äôs most critical ‚Äì and challenging ‚Äì public health crises of our generation: childhood obesity. A lecturer at Stanford School of Medicine and in Stanford University‚Äôs human biology program, she is leading the cause through education.

1591,TeLiBBxI,Foods You are NOT Allowed to Eat In the USA !,"Whether it‚Äôs rotten cheese consumed by maggots, or mysterious brownies that make you really sleepy, here are foods you‚Äôre not allowed to eat in the US

Subscribe to American Eye 

6. Mirabelle Plum
Don‚Äôt get caught acting suspicious around the police if you got a few of these illegal plums stashed on you! These plums you see here are grown only in the Lorraine region of France and people from the US won‚Äôt get to taste them unless they travel to western europe. You‚Äôre probably thinking, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the big deal‚Äù? They‚Äôre just plums for crying out loud not an endangered species or anything. It‚Äôs somewhat of a mystery why exactly they‚Äôre banned but the answer seems to come down to money. In order to protect the financial income of the eastern province in France, most countries have agreed not to sell them. It‚Äôs a little bit similar to how we have to have the differences between Champagne and Sparkling water. Whatever the reason exactly might be, you aren‚Äôt allowed to eat them, cuz we said so! 

5. Unpasteurized Milk
Most of the milk we drink and the cheese we eat must go through a process known as pasteurization first before we consume it. The process was introduced by Louis Pasteur in the 1860‚Äôs and This kills the bacteria and other microbes which would be harmful for consumption . not only that but this allows for it to be stored on the shelf longer. Although some states allow the sale for raw milk 17 states have banned it. Those who are in favor of non pasteurization claim that the milk loses many of its nutrients once it goes through the process.  But those who claim pasteurized milk is the way to go state that too many diseases are spread from just raw milk. In any case, it is probably best not to drink raw milk unless it‚Äôs from the mom to the offspring

4. Lazy Cakes
This cakes are banned in arkansas and strangely enough, they might actually make you feel lazy. The brownies are laced with melatonin and are known to cause severe drowsiness. Melatonin is often used as an over the counter sleep supplement and typically isn‚Äôt found in our food. Rumors went on full effect when people started saying that they put some type of synthetic cannabis substance in there but in any case they will make people sleepy. Maybe people who sell them don‚Äôt realize they‚Äôre not your average brownie, and you have to kind of read the fine print to find out. 


3. Pig‚Äôs Blood Cake
Who on Earth would eat something that sounds this horrifying? If you guessed the Taiwanese, good job! Pig‚Äôs blood cake has been banned in the US due to sanitary reasons and whatever other reason they find is fine by me. No need to guess what the secret ingredient is with this one. It‚Äôs basically like a street food delicacy that‚Äôs made with soy broth, sticky rice and oh yeah, pigs blood! The rice is then dipped in blood and deep fried. Other ingredients might be used to coat the deep fried pig blood on a stick but once you eat it, you have to live with yourself! Supporters of the treat claim there is no sanitary issues with the preparation process but it‚Äôs still banned here!


2. Conch Queen
This beautiful shellfish becomes actually pretty tasty once you open it up and eat it. The conch queen is a banned food in the US to import mostly because overfishing threatens its existence. It‚Äôs actually more like a giant sea snail which has a very sturdy shell. The caribbean is the main exporter of conch meat to the us and demand for it quite high and the US is responsible for 80 percent of the consumption of this endangered creature.  


Purple Mangosteen 
One forbidden fruit that you probably shouldn‚Äôt eat or at least be aware of is the purple mangosteen. This is a highly sought after fruit which which a delicacy in thailand must be destroyed completely if it‚Äôs found in the US! The problem isn‚Äôt that it‚Äôs a rare fruit or anything but the goal isr to keep the asian fruit fly out, which is responsible for complete destruction of some crops. The tropical species has already wreaked havoc on the state of Florida and we don‚Äôt want this thing in our country! It‚Äôs been notorious for attacking over 400 different species of fruits and vegetables.",Food

1619,F5LVBW1vl8,Manufacturing plywood boards: then and now,"Plywood is a simple material made by glueing together thin sheets of wood, known as veneers or plies. These basic elements have remained broadly the same throughout its history. The most significant breakthrough in its production came in the early 1800s with the development of steam-powered machines that could cut veneers cheaply. The most influential of these was the rotary veneer cutter.

The cutter rotates a log against a wide, horizontal blade, causing it to ‚Äòpeel‚Äô into a continuous sheet of wood. This enables the creation of longer, wider sheets of veneer than previously possible and with little waste. Using these machines meant that plywood could be manufactured quickly and inexpensively on a large scale.

This film shows the stages in manufacturing plywood boards in the mid-20th century and today. The process remains essentially unchanged, although today many of the machines are much faster and computer controlled. 

Produced as part of the V&A exhibition Plywood: Material of the Modern World (15 July ‚Äì 12 November 2017) 

Sponsored by MADE.COM. Supported by the American Friends of the V&A

1630,7YvJB0n16I,Push vs Pull with Kanban - Manufacturing (Free Simulation),"Lean Simulation:  Push vs Pull with Kanban - Manufacturing

This video shows a preview of a Push versus Pull computer simulation model by The Big Lean Simulation Library:  



From here, you can obtain the full version of the video tutorial, the simulation model itself, and how-to instructions for demonstrating the model.  You can show this as part of your Lean Six Sigma course offerings (LSS White Belt, Yellow Belt, Green Belt, Black Belt, Master Black Belt.).  Lean and Lean Six Sigma consultants can also use it as a tool to sell your Lean consulting work to management and executives.  Advanced practitioners will already know the concepts but will appreciate the ability to show them to others in an easy to understand format.

This simulation consists of three scenarios.

Scenario 1:  This shows a push manufacturing system.  The first workstation produces a run of 100 parts.  The second workstation processes those parts at a slower rate.  As a result, the ""pushed"" parts add excess inventory and Work-In-Process (WIP).  In addition, the first workstation experiences a quality problem after 30 documents.  As a result, about 70 defective parts are produced before the downstream workstation catches the problem and tells the first workstation.

Scenario 2:  In this scenario, we use a Pull based kanban system to process parts only when the second workstation is able to process them.  As a result, key metrics for Work-In-Process and quality are dramatically improved while still producing at the same rate.

Scenario 3:  Travel time is reduced, thus allowing fewer kanbans.  All metrics are improved further.

The final view shows optional discussion bullet points.

Maruti Suzuki leads from the front with a massive market share of over 49 percent followed by Hyundai Motor India. Here is a complete analysis of auto sales in India and what to expect going forward in 2018. With all eyes on Auto Expo 2018, expect car sales in India to further grow this year. Please follow the list below :


* 10. Volkswagen: This German manufacturer just edges past Chevrolet to make it into this Top 10 list for 2018. A large part of its success is driven by the Polo hatchback and Vento sedan models. As part of the Volkswagen AG group, brands like Audi and Skoda also contribute to the sales numbers.

* 9. Nissan: The Indian arm of Japanese automobile manufacturer Nissan Motor Company's wholesale deliveries reported an increase of 39 percent in April 2017 to 4,217 vehicles. The company, in a statement, has credited this growth in sales to customer demand for the Datsun Redi-GO.
 
* 8. Ford India: As a brand, Ford has its share of loyalists in India. Their Ikon 1.6 and subsequently Fiesta S have been driver-centric cars. At the other end of the market, they also have the Endeavour ‚Äì one of India‚Äôs‚Äô first true SUVs, with a ladder-on-frame construction, butch styling, and impressive road presence.

* 7. Renault: This French manufacturer has a range that covers most segments in the Indian market. They have the entry-level Pulse hatchback, which is a rebadged Nissan Micra, as part of its alliance with Nissan Motors in India. The Scala sedan is a popular sedan and shares its market space with the Nissan Sunny.

* 6. Toyota: The name has become synonymous with quality. This has been a constant refrain with the owners and drivers of its most popular product in India, the Innova. Despite the premium pricing and long waiting periods, the Innova continues to be the market leader in its segment every month.

* 5. Honda Cars: As a brand name, Honda has always held a special place in the hearts of Indians. The interiors are of good quality, and the ride and handling are comfortable. Honda‚Äôs after sales service is one of the best and is responsible for most of its repeat customers.

* 4. Tata Motors: A massive automotive company with an incredible range of vehicles, Tata nevertheless has struggled sometimes when it comes to passenger cars. They had a very successful run with the Indica and Indigo series of hatchbacks and sedans.

* 3. Mahindra & Mahindra: India popular home-grown automaker, Mahindra has been a leader in transportation in rural areas. They have focused on a strong, rugged image and built a reputation for reliability. Coupled with value for money features, Mahindra vehicles have become known for being easy to own and cheap to maintain.

* 2. Hyundai India: As a brand, Hyundai was unknown when it launched in India. From there to becoming India‚Äôs second Best build car brand is a success story that needs to be told. The very first model they launched, the Santro was an unmitigated success.

* 1. Maruti Suzuki: Our very own Maruti Suzuki holds an impressive 42% of the market at the end of last month. They sold over 92000 vehicles in thirty days. And this was not a great month ‚Äì in fact, it was the lowest in over a year. The average monthly sales are actually over 110000.

1670,2jIbhRPCJG4,Google Glass on the Manufacturing Floor using Proceedix,"AGCO‚Äôs Jackson, Minnesota manufacturing team has incorporated Google Glass to audit finished product before it is shipped to dealers for consumer purchase.   Wearable technology allows the Quality team to thoroughly inspect tractors while improving standards in safety, checklist documentation, issue trending and throughput.  Although Glass still feels as futuristic of a technology as flying cars, AGCO has embraced the elaborate electronic devices, making use of voice activated commands and eye winks as daily tools.  In addition to the efficiency that voice and eye motion bring to the process, the simple fact that the quality technicians are no longer carrying devices, allowing for hands free inspection and focus on safety has increased throughput, safety records and checkpoint reliability.   Checklists are now smart, following model specifications and presenting instructional diagrams and text that drive the technician‚Äôs response and follow-up actions.  Every point on the checklists requires action and offers a level of detail that allows on the job training for newer employees and newly released model specifications. 
As Agricultural equipment companies continue to competitively advance their technologies to help farmers maximize their yield, the complexities to produce the machines increases.  As the world also continues to battle a shortage of skilled manufacturing workers, solutions like wearable technology, offering immediate access to instructions and information will become required.  The company‚Äôs that realize this and find solutions will be in positions to not only succeed in, but win, the global markets. ",Manufacturing

1682,Kslh8XUphJ,IACMI Wind Blade Prototype (Composites Manufacturing Innovation),"Knoxville, TN, January 31, 2017‚Äî The Institute for Advanced Composites Manufacturing Innovation (IACMI) unveiled an advanced technology prototype wind blade during the Winter IACMI members meeting February 1-2 in Denver, Colorado. The nine- meter long blade was fabricated at IACMI‚Äôs Wind Technology Area in the Denver, Colorado area. Commercialization of the wind blade prototype created could speed production times, reduce manufacture cost, and provide stronger, more energy-efficient blades for the United States.

A large team of eleven industrial partners, including Arkema Inc., Johns Manville, TPI Composites Inc., Huntsman Polyurethanes, Strongwell, DowAksa USA, Chomarat North America, Composites One, SikaAxson, Creative Foam and Chem-Trend, provided materials and on site fabrication support for blade component manufacturing and assembly. Pultruded spar caps were fabricated at Strongwell in Bristol, Virginia and shipped to Colorado for incorporation into the blade shells. The project was led by IACMI‚Äôs Wind Technology Area, based in the Denver, Colorado area , with support from IACMI Headquarters, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), the U.S. Department of Energy‚Äôs Advanced Manufacturing Office, and the Advanced Industries Program administered by the Colorado Office of Economic Trade and Development (OEDIT).

The prototype blade is based on an existing design from previous work conducted by the DOE, representing a small-scale version of a utility-scale multi-megawatt blade. The new blade, molded on tooling supplied by TPI Composites, Inc., features innovations such as impact resistant components, continuous fiber reinforced thermoplastic parts and exterior shell components produced with less than half the normal CO2 emissions commonly emitted in wind blade manufacture.",Manufacturing

1694,-bDtCwNo-,Traditional Enamel Dial Manufacturing,"Dials made of enamel can last forever, have a great smooth aspect, are prestigious because of their very artisenal production process and have existed since the 17th century. We find them today in historical pieces visible in museums. This technique was used until the beginning of the 20th century. Then metal dials replaced them because it became possible to add colorful decorations. Since then, enamel has used mostly been used on exclusive watches. 

Enamel is composed of glass powder extracted from silica. We don‚Äôt produce enamel powder ourselves; we buy it from companies mostly based in France, the United Kingdom, and the United-States. They contain metal oxides that give different colors to the substance, essentially added to transparent enamels. The whiteness and opacity of the white enamel dial comes from the breakdown of arsenic. But today, there is no substitute for obtaining the whiteness we have on our dials, for instance. We work following the same traditional method used before.

This starts with a disc made out of copper. This precise metal is used because of its maneuverability. It allows us to create dials with different shapes, both domed and flat. First, we weld feet to the back of the disc. Then we heat the dial to about 950¬∞C to relax the metal. The process continues by cleaning it and scrubbing it to reintroduce some tension. Thus, the piece remains solid during the next operations. The first layers of enamel are put on the back and front of the dial at the same time by dusting enamel powder before putting it in the kiln for the first time. The back layer is necessary as every new one added on the front adds tension to the metal. Without it, the dial would bend and finally break.

A dial made out of enamel is like gold: timeless.",Manufacturing

1700,qIcV09YbAE,Artificial intelligence in manufacturing: Game changer or just another hype?,"Most people agree that artificial intelligence will have a huge impact on the way Europeans will produce and consume in the future. However, there are differing views on what the European Union can do to tap the full potential of AI in manufacturing and while coping with possible challenges.

The debate is often driven by pessimistic scenarios such as disrupted industrial structures and mass unemployment. This rarely reflects the daily life of European manufacturers who develop ways to use AI for a more efficient and clean production ‚Äì and who need a political framework for the use of such technologies. In April, the European Commission published its AI strategy with the aim to facilitate the uptake of AI in Europe. 

EURACTIV organised this workshop to discuss how AI is used by manufacturers and the regulatory framework at the Union level. Questions included:

- Will AI disrupt industry, or will it be just another step in its evolution?
- Do we need new EU legislation, for instance new liability rules?
- Is the Commission‚Äôs recent Communication on AI appropriate and strong enough?
- Is the European industry competitive compared to superpowers like the US or China in the field of AI? Does the EU risk lagging behind?
- Will AI lead to mass unemployment in Europe? What can be done to prevent it?",Manufacturing

Bleaching powder is also called calcium chlorohypochlorite because it is considered as a mixed salt of hydrochloric acid and hypochlorous acid. Bleaching Powder is an oxidizing agent and the activity is measured in terms of available chlorine, which is the same weight as that of gaseous or liquid chlorine that would exert the same action as the chlorine compound. Bleaching powder is used to whiting or removing the natural color of textile fibers, yarns, wood pulp, paper and other products by chemical reaction and also is an additive in the scouring powder preparation as germicide.

Bleacing powder is calcium hypochlorite (Ca (OCl) 2). It is a one of the major chemical industry in the world. Limestone and chlorine gas are used as raw materials to manufacture bleaching powder which is used as a disinfectant and as an oxidizing agent. Bleaching powder show different reactions.

MANUFACURE OF PORTLAND CEMENT:Raw Materials: The raw materials required for cement manufacture are. Lime stone which provides calcium. Clay which provides aluminium and silica.Cement is manufactured by two methods they are. Wet process. Dry process. Now let us discuss wet process and dry process detailed.WET PROCESS:In the wet process, first the clay is purified by washing in a wash mill.The lime stone is crushed into small particles and mixed with purified clay in proper proportions to get raw slurry.DRY PROCESS: In the dry process the raw materials are mixed in proper proportions.The mixture is dried, pulverized (Crushed into fine particles) and made uniform. The resulting powder is called ""raw material"".The raw slurry or raw meal, obtained by one of wet or dry process called charge. Charge is introduced into a rotary Kiln.The rotary kiln consists of a steel cylinder about 150meters long and 4meter diameter and rotates 30 to 60 turns per hour.At one end of the cylinder a screw conveyer is arranged which slowly allows the charge into the cylinder.The other end of the cylinder, a burneris arranged coal or burning oil is burnt at this end.The charge entering the cylinder slowly moves towards the hot end.At the burning end of the kiln, the temperature is around 1700 to 1900degrees centigrade, at this end some chemical reactions takes place between calcium oxide and aluminium silicates.Mixture of calcium silicates and calcium aluminates is formed.The resultant product consists of gray hard balls called clinker cement.Clinker cement is cooled, ground to fine powder and mixed with 2 to 3 percent of gypsum.",Manufacturing

1727,f-tQYcZGM4,üì∫ Noam Chomsky's Manufacturing Consent revisited | The Listening Post,"There is an exquisite and oft-quoted moment in an interview between BBC journalist Andrew Marr and Noam Chomsky in which Marr asks: ""How can you know that I'm self-censoring?"".

""I'm not saying you're self censoring. I'm sure you believe everything you're saying. But what I'm saying is that if you believed something different, you wouldn't be sitting where you're sitting.""

Wry as ever, Chomsky exposed the slightly delusional pretensions of the journalistic establishment - and not far behind, the complicities of the media industry with political power.

Harsh? Perhaps. True? All too often.

For many of us who work at The Listening Post, Chomsky's ideas on the media in Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media have provided us with a guide, full of cautionary tales and ideas that are still controversial to this day.

The book was published in 1988 - a year before the end of the Cold War when it was announced that western liberal democracy had triumphed, heralding the end of ideology, authoritarianism, and propaganda.

In the past 30 years, we have seen the mass communications industry multiply, providing an illusion of choice, echoing the rhetorics of freedom - of press, of expression - but not necessarily yielding the pluralism liberal democracies had promised.

In that way, the book continues to resonate.

But like all revered texts, Manufacturing Consent also calls upon us as active readers, journalists, citizens to interrogate its premises. Does the book's denunciatory tone risk overstate the power of the media establishment? Does it underestimate the critical faculties of the public? Is the media so homogenous an entity that power can be wielded top-down? Where are the lapses, the blind spots? Where do journalists find pockets of power that serve to disrupt?

We spoke to three journalists who have their careers being disruptive and asked them about the ideas that had influenced them in Chomsky and Herman's book: Matt Taibbi, whose reporting for Rolling Stone has provided one of the most critical accounts of US political history in recent years; Indian editor-in-chief Aman Sethi who questions the premises of Chomsky's book and Amira Hass, the Haaretz correspondent for the Occupied Territories.

The first thing we asked Hass was what she thought about Chomsky's statement: ""the general population doesn't know what's happening, and it doesn't even know that it doesn't know"".

""This is a very humanist and optimistic statement,"" she responded. ""The belief that when people are informed they may act, things may change. In Hebrew, the words knowledge and awareness are all made of the same root. Yedda and Mudaoot. And so awareness is connected to Mudaoot in Hebrew. And this is how I started working in Gaza, aware that the Israeli public knows nothing about the occupation and what it means. But the people do not pick up this information. They have access to it but they choose not to access it.""

Hass has been covering Palestine for the best part of 30 years - in that time, sources of information have multiplied, but public outrage?

""Today we have so much access to information in other ways that we are on a collision with the fact that people are not interested in what does not serve immediately their interest,"" she said, with resignation, ""and this is a very sad realisation.""

Aman Sethi put it like this:

""It's easy to say that people believe what they believe because their consent has been manufactured. But what if people know exactly what's going on and still believe what they believe, right? Then that's terrifying.""

1730,fRYIJuq6l4,Manufacturing Day 2013,"Manufacturing sure ain't what it used to be. Gone are the days where every manufacturing job meant backbreaking and/or dangerous labor. Though a great amount of skill is still required these days to produce consistently high quality products in large volumes, many production environments are now equipped with both safer materials and high-precision, lower-force robotics that allow us to build more intricate devices than ever before.

Here at SparkFun, we embrace our robotic friends that work tirelessly to help us produce thousands of circuit boards and electronics kits each day for the innovators, tinkerers, creative technologists, and tech education providers all across the world. We appreciate our machines for their quirks (robots aren't perfect, you know) so long as they don't frown upon our own. True to our D.I.Y. ethos, we have always believed that it is far more satisfying to manufacture our own product designs rather than outsource them to someone else. And, as is to be expected, we have learned many valuable lessons as the demand for our circuit boards and kits has grown over the years. But through those lessons, we continue to improve. We believe that our success lies in our openness to trying new things, dedicating ourselves to an insatiable appetite for high quality products, and being true to who we are without regard for ""industry norms.""

It is always rewarding to see the endless stream of amazing projects from the D.I.Y. community come to life, with the circuit boards and kits that we personally built here in Boulder, CO, playing a small role in those creations! A big thank you to those of you who share with us and the world what you have built and what you have learned through your own designing and building! And thank you for being as truly unique and geeky as we are...

                                     Industry 4.0 is a name given to the current trend of automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies. It includes cyber-physical systems, the Internet of things, cloud computing and cognitive computing. Industry 4.0 is commonly referred to as the fourth industrial revolution.

Industry 4.0 fosters what has been called a ""smart factory"". Within modular structured smart factories, cyber-physical systems monitor physical processes, create a virtual copy of the physical world and make decentralized decisions. Over the Internet of Things, cyber-physical systems communicate and cooperate with each other and with humans in real-time both internally and across organizational services offered and used by participants of the value chain.

                     Smart manufacturing is a broad category of manufacturing that employs computer-integrated manufacturing, high levels of adaptability and rapid design changes, digital information technology, and more flexible technical workforce training. Other goals sometimes include fast changes in production levels based on demand,optimization of the supply chain, efficient production and recyclability. In this concept, as smart factory has interoperable systems, multi-scale dynamic modelling and simulation, intelligent automation, strong cyber security, and networked sensors.
             Big data processing
Smart manufacturing utilizes big data analytics, to refine complicated processes and manage supply chains.[7] Big data analytics refers to a method for gathering and understanding large data sets .
The broad definition of smart manufacturing covers many different technologies. Some of the key technologies in the smart manufacturing movement include big data processing capabilities, industrial connectivity devices and services, and advanced robotics.

MANUFACURE OF PORTLAND CEMENT:Raw Materials: The raw materials required for cement manufacture are. Lime stone which provides calcium. Clay which provides aluminium and silica.Cement is manufactured by two methods they are. Wet process. Dry process. Now let us discuss wet process and dry process detailed.WET PROCESS:In the wet process, first the clay is purified by washing in a wash mill.The lime stone is crushed into small particles and mixed with purified clay in proper proportions to get raw slurry.DRY PROCESS: In the dry process the raw materials are mixed in proper proportions.The mixture is dried, pulverized (Crushed into fine particles) and made uniform. The resulting powder is called ""raw material"".The raw slurry or raw meal, obtained by one of wet or dry process called charge. Charge is introduced into a rotary Kiln.The rotary kiln consists of a steel cylinder about 150meters long and 4meter diameter and rotates 30 to 60 turns per hour.At one end of the cylinder a screw conveyer is arranged which slowly allows the charge into the cylinder.The other end of the cylinder, a burneris arranged coal or burning oil is burnt at this end.The charge entering the cylinder slowly moves towards the hot end.At the burning end of the kiln, the temperature is around 1700 to 1900degrees centigrade, at this end some chemical reactions takes place between calcium oxide and aluminium silicates.Mixture of calcium silicates and calcium aluminates is formed.The resultant product consists of gray hard balls called clinker cement.Clinker cement is cooled, ground to fine powder and mixed with 2 to 3 percent of gypsum.",Manufacturing

When starting a clothing line it's important to know the process, and this video is a great way to learn what it takes to create a t-shirt from scratch. 

Sign up to the newsletter and receive free downloads to help grow your business + enter to win upcoming giveaways:   

The following steps can be applied to make any product, so feel free to jot down notes and reference this section for future use. 

Step 1: T-Shirt Design 
The first step to making a t-shirt involves the design sketch. Create a sketch that depicts the angles and details you'd like the final shirt to have. It doesn't have to be super fancy, as long as you can show what you need. Designing a shirt with the end goal in mind helps the pattern maker know what you are going for. Thanks you Torey Lewitz for joining us.

Step 2: Pattern Making
Once the designs are completed, you will consult with a pattern maker to bring your clothing line to life. The pattern maker will take your designs and create ‚Äúpatterns‚Äù which are the pieces that will be cut and sewn together. 

Step 3: Sample Cutting
Once the patterns are completed, they are printing on a plotter that creates the outline for the sample cutter. The person in charge of cutting the sample will follow the guides to ensure the pieces are cut to the right specifications. Castle Notches allow the person in charge of sewing to close the product up right. 

Step 4: Sewing The T-Shirt
After the fabric is cut out, it is ready to be sewn. The cut pieces are now the shape of the patterns and multiple sewing machines are used to finish the design. The final outcome is hopefully what you envisioned. But more than likely it won‚Äôt be the final fit, so you will repeat the process until you are happy with the size, fit and shape of your apparel line. 

Step 5: Mass Production Cutting
As soon as the shirt or apparel design you created is approved, the patterns are finalized and sent into the production process. John Chacon Head Of Production walks us through his process. 

Step 6: Mass Production Sewing 
Once the pieces are all cut out, they are sent to the sewing factory. The factory is given the cut fabric and the head of production is in charge of making sure everyone knows what their role is. 

Step 7: Order Fulfillment/ Clothing Line Distribution
The last step in this video is the order fulfillment and distribution of the finished clothing. As a clothing business you also have to think about how you will provide quicker shipping, handle returns and manage employees. Randy Pinter Head of Warehouse Distribution drops the knowledge on what it takes to run this facility.

1756,HiMzDP3pU,The New Manufacturing: Ted Hall at TEDxRichmond,"Ted Hall, founder and CEO of ShopBot Tools, Inc., first got excited about digital fabrication 20 years ago. Ted wanted a digitally controlled tool that would cut plywood parts for backyard boatbuilding projects. In trying to find such a tool, he learned that the CNC (computer numerically controlled) technology of the time was heavily industrial and oriented to high-volume manufacturing. Ted's idea, which would become ShopBot, was to create a digital fabrication tool that was instead oriented to use by individuals and small shops. A tool that took advantage of the technology's capability to cut, drill, sculpt, machine, carve, or trim with high precision and in relation to a digital model -- but that made sense in a small shop for making one object or many, and that empowered individuals through the new technology with enhanced capabilities to express their creativity in projects of all sizes and using a wide range of materials.

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",Manufacturing

But those jobs haven't disappeared for the reasons you may think, says border and logistics specialist Augie Picado. He gives us a reality check about what global trade really looks like and how shared production and open borders help us make higher quality products at lower costs.

This movie shows you the process of manufacturing solar cells with heterojunction technology:

Texturing
For high efficiency HJT cells, damages from cutting have to be completely removed and a special texture created by wet chemical processes. The wafers are also put through a special cleaning process.

PECVD Coating
The surface of the cell is passivated  in order to prevent energy loss within the cell. The intrinsic and amorphous silicon layers are separated without cross-contamination, thus achieving passivation with a high longevity.

PVD Coating
A sputter process is used to apply a TCO layer to the front and back of the wafer which serves as an antireflection layer.

Printing
Screen printing is used to print the contacts on the front and back sides of wafers with silver paste.

Curing
Curing printed HJT cells is a simple thermal process in order to outgas the solvents within the low temperature paste.


Testing & Sorting
Meyer Burger offers leading measurement procedures for the precise testing of high capacitance HJT cells which require a measurement speed of 400‚Äì600 ms.",Manufacturing

1875,GEgaV0aFBsg,Solar Cell Manufacturing with Heterojunction Technology,"The heterojunction technology combines the advantages of crystalline silicon solar cells and thin film technologies enabling solar cell to reach higher degrees of efficiency at a lower cost of production.

This movie shows you the process of manufacturing solar cells with heterojunction technology:

Texturing
For high efficiency HJT cells, damages from cutting have to be completely removed and a special texture created by wet chemical processes. The wafers are also put through a special cleaning process.

PECVD Coating
The surface of the cell is passivated  in order to prevent energy loss within the cell. The intrinsic and amorphous silicon layers are separated without cross-contamination, thus achieving passivation with a high longevity.

PVD Coating
A sputter process is used to apply a TCO layer to the front and back of the wafer which serves as an antireflection layer.

Printing
Screen printing is used to print the contacts on the front and back sides of wafers with silver paste.

Curing
Curing printed HJT cells is a simple thermal process in order to outgas the solvents within the low temperature paste.


Testing & Sorting

LG brought Digital Trends along on an exclusive tour of several of its labs and factories halfway around the globe in Seoul, South Korea -- and we‚Äôre bringing you inside with us.

Make no mistake: Much of what we saw was confidential information, of the ‚ÄúI could tell you but I‚Äôd have to kill you‚Äù sort. But we can share enough to give you a rare peek behind the curtain.

The Paju complex is made up of eight enormous buildings each seemingly larger than an airport terminal that sit on 420 acres. A ninth, called P9, is currently under construction. When completed, it will be the world‚Äôs largest OLED manufacturing plant. More than 17,000 people work at Paju, many living in enormous residential complexes on site. 

We flew on the LG helicopter an hour south to the Gumi facility, where LG assembles OLED and LED televisions. It was especially big: Picture several warehouses fused together. It doesn‚Äôt require the clean-room garb we donned for phone assembly. Because technology changes so rapidly, assembly lines are designed to be modular. 

The Seocho Research & Development facility. It was born in 2009, and over 3000 people work there, giving birth to high-tech ideas from a glimmering pool of silicon and ambition. And as such, it‚Äôs one of the super secretive facilities that LG guards closely: Admission to Seocho meant forfeiting cell phones and laptops, signing non-disclosure forms, and so on. Indeed, we were only allowed to record a short video outside of the building.

1889,TWIIhKI8cA,How to Design and Manufacture a Product,"It can be quite a challenge to find a manufacturer -- one you like working with and whose factory produces a quality product at a fair price. Here are some tips on how to navigate through the process of finding one, as well as how to optimize your relationship with your manufacturer so that you -- and your customers -- are happy. For more infor visit: 


Step 1: Creating a Prototype

Creating a working prototype or finding someone who can do it for you is the first step in the manufacturing process. During my early days, I was able to sew most of my prototypes. But as my product, Planecomfort, was refined and the components used and the skills necessary to create the product I envisioned moved beyond my sewing expertise, I knew I needed help. Searching online, I found a wonderful yet small cut-and-sew business in northern California called Left in Stitches.
This relationship proved valuable to me in a number of ways. They not only helped refine my original prototype, but they offered many suggestions and ideas for making the product easier to manufacture. Many of these smaller domestic companies offer prototyping services that are invaluable to new entrepreneurs.
Once you have a prototype, there is quality and design testing and tweaking. At each stage of development, and every time I received the newer version of my product, I washed, dried, pulled, stretched, zipped, unzipped, and put my product through the proverbial ""ringer."" Making sure your product will exceed your customers' expectations is a sure way to keep them coming back and referring your product to others.
Ideally, you want to have a dozen or so finished prototypes. Manufacturers will want one or two samples sent to them as a reference to compare to the finished product their factory is making.
I thought I would be able to use Left in Stitches for the long term, but due to logistical reasons and production costs, I had to find an overseas manufacturer. Moving your manufacturing operations overseas means you want large quantities (usually thousands) of the item you are producing. If you want hundreds of something, you may be better off working with a domestic manufacturer.
Step 2: Finding a Manufacturer

I located my overseas manufacturers through referrals, which provided me with an immediate level of comfort and confidence with these factories. One referral came from a fabric manufacturer. Most fabric manufacturers have relationships with product manufacturers.
Another factory was referred to me by a marketing services company. This company manufactures both soft and hard goods and was happy to provide their contact with another business opportunity. Call domestic manufacturers and inquire about their overseas connections. Ask everyone you know if they know someone who manufactures the type of products you are creating. Search online for companies with products similar to yours and call them. Who do they use? How did they get started? My experience is that most people will want to help you.
I found it was best to work with at least two different companies when trying to decide who will win your business. Who is easiest to work with? Who meets (or beats) your expectations? Is one more knowledgeable than the other? Having a comparison is essential to ensure you are getting a quality product at a fair price.
There are two common ways you can deal with overseas manufacturing. You can find a broker or agent in the U.S. that represents the factory, or deal with a factory directly.

Once you have determined who you might like to work with, you must check references on your contact and the factory. Some of the important questions to ask:
Was the product made to specifications?
What percentage of the shipment was defective?
If there was a problem with the shipment, did the factory make restitution?
Were deadlines met? If not, what did the factory offer to make amends?
Is what was promised delivered?
How is the quality of goods they produce?
How long have you worked with this person and factory?
How many orders have you placed?
Is your contact easy to work with?
Is he/she responsive to calls and emails?
What type of projects does the factory excel in producing? Soft goods, hard goods?
What types of companies do they normally work with?
Who is responsible for landing the goods in the U.S.?

The Mughal Empire (also referred to as Baburid Empire, Baburid Dynasty) was founded by Zahiriddin Muhammad Babur, a Timurid prince and ruler from Turan or Turkistan, i.e. Central Asia (Uzbekistan). Babur was a direct descendant to the Turkic Emperor Timur on his father's side and also had links to Chagatai, the second son of the Mongol ruler Genghis Khan, on his mother‚Äôs side.Ousted from his ancestral domains in Turkistan by Sheybani Khan, the 14-year old Prince Babur turned to India to satisfy his ambitions. He established himself in Kabul and then pushed steadily southward into India from Afghanistan through the Khyber Pass. Babur's forces occupied much of northern India after his victory at Panipat in 1526. The preoccupation with wars and military campaigns, however, did not allow the new emperor to consolidate the gains he had made in India.The instability of the empire became evident under his son, Humayun, who was driven out of India and into Persia by rebels.Humayun's exile in Persia established diplomatic ties between the Safavid and Mughal Courts, and led to increasing West Asian cultural influence in the Mughal court. The restoration of Mughal rule began after Humayun‚Äôs triumphant return from Persia in 1555, but he died from a fatal accident shortly afterwards.Humayun's son, Akbar, succeeded to the throne under a regent, Bairam Khan, who helped consolidate the Mughal Empire in India.

Through warfare and diplomacy, Akbar was able to extend the empire in all directions, and controlled almost the entire Indian subcontinent north of the Godavari river. He created a new class of nobility loyal to him from the military aristocracy of India's social groups, implemented a modern government and supported cultural developments. At the same time Akbar intensified trade with European trading companies. The Indian historian Abraham Eraly wrote that foreigners were often impressed by the fabulous wealth of the Mughal court, but the glittering court hid darker realities, namely that about a quarter of the empire's gross national product was owned by 655 families while the bulk of India's 120 million people lived in appalling poverty.After suffering what appears to have been an epileptic seizure in 1578 while hunting tigers, which he regarded as a religious experience, Akbar grew disenchanted with Islam, and came to embrace a syncretistic mixture of Hinduism and Islam.Akbar allowed free expression of religion and attempted to resolve socio-political and cultural differences in his empire by establishing a new religion, Din-i-Ilahi, with strong characteristics of a ruler cult. He left his successors an internally stable state, which was in the midst of its golden age, but before long signs of political weakness would emerge. Akbar's son, Jahangir, ruled the empire at its peak, but he was addicted to opium, neglected the affairs of the state, and came under the influence of rival court cliques. During the reign of Jahangir's son, Shah Jahan, the culture and splendour of the luxurious Mughal court reached its zenith as exemplified by the Taj Mahal.The maintenance of the court, at this time, began to cost more than the revenue

1926,N7VQas4OgQ,The History of Earth - Full Documentary HD,"n the very beginning of earth's history, this planet was a giant, red hot, roiling, boiling sea of molten rock - a magma ocean. The heat had been generated by the repeated high speed collisions of much smaller bodies of space rocks that continually clumped together as they collided to form this planet. As the collisions tapered off the earth began to cool, forming a thin crust on its surface. As the cooling continued, water vapor began to escape and condense in the earth's early atmosphere. Clouds formed and storms raged, raining more and more water down on the primitive earth, cooling the surface further until it was flooded with water, forming the seas.

It is theorized that the true age of the earth is about 4.6 billion years old, formed at about the same time as the rest of our solar system. The oldest rocks geologists have been able to find are 3.9 billion years old. Using radiometric dating methods to determine the age of rocks means scientists have to rely on when the rock was initially formed (as in - when its internal minerals first cooled). In the infancy of our home planet the entire earth was molten rock - a magma ocean.

Since we can only measure as far back in time as we had solid rock on this planet, we are limited in how we can measure the real age of the earth. Due to the forces of plate tectonics, our planet is also a very dynamic one; new mountains forming, old ones wearing down, volcanoes melting and reshaping new crust. The continual changing and reshaping of the earth's surface that involves the melting down and reconstructing of old rock has pretty much eliminated most of the original rocks that came with earth when it was newly formed. So the age is a theoretical age.

When Did Life on Earth Begin?

Scientists are still trying to unravel one of the greatest mysteries of earth: When did ""life"" first appear and how did it happen? It is estimated that the first life forms on earth were primitive, one-celled creatures that appeared about 3 billion years ago. That's pretty much all there was for about the next two billion years. Then suddenly those single celled organisms began to evolve into multicellular organisms. Then an unprecedented profusion of life in incredibly complex forms began to fill the oceans. Some crawled from the seas and took residence on land, perhaps to escape predators in the ocean. A cascading chain of new and increasingly differentiated forms of life appeared all over the planet, only to be virtually annihilated by an unexplained mass extinction. It would be the first of several mass extinctions in Earth's history.

Scientists have been looking increasingly to space to explain these mass extinctions that have been happening almost like clockwork since the beginning of ""living"" time. Perhaps we've been getting periodically belted by more space rocks (ie. asteroids), or the collision of neutron stars happening too close for comfort? Each time a mass extinction occurred, life found a way to come back from the brink. Life has tenaciously clung to this small blue planet for the last three billion years. Scientists are finding new cues as to how life first began on earth in some really interesting places - the deep ocean.",History

Today, we use a shotgun in every single Call of Duty game ever made!

‚Ä¶except for the first COD game, Big Red One, Call of Duty Online, and Call of Duty Mobile‚Ä¶

lol

I decided to do a challenge video AGAIN; play every Call of Duty game ever made in one video, and try to get as many kills in Team Deathmatch in 1 minute, but this time with Shotguns!

This video includes gameplay and some of my opinions about Call of Duty 2, Call of Duty 3, Call of Duty 4, Call of Duty: World at War, Modern Warfare 2, Black Ops 1, Modern Warfare 3, Black Ops 2, Call of Duty: Ghosts, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, Black Ops 3, Modern Warfare Remastered, Infinite Warfare, Call of Duty WW2, and Black Ops 4! That‚Äôs 15 Call of Duty games in ONE video‚Ä¶WOW

All of this footage was captured on the Xbox One at 1080p 60fps and on the PS4 at 1080p 60fps so you can see all of the graphic and gameplay changes over time!

The shotguns of Call of Duty have changed a lot over time; from the classic M1897 Trench Gun to the Brecci, COD shotguns went from 0 to 100 real quick!

As usual, I‚Äôm really surprised with the results of this challenge video as well‚Ä¶

So, what do YOU think is the best shotgun in Call of Duty of ALL TIME? Which COD game do you think has the most fun to use shotguns? Leave a comment letting me know! :D

Rich soil always appreciates good care so it can provide miraculous natural gifts to the farmer. However, James Bristle, a farmer from Michigan, got something more exciting from the ground. He had a field to grow soybeans and one day he noticed something sticking out of the ground that looked like an old decayed fence post at first sight. However, the find turned out to be much more amazing. James got an excavator to dig deeper and was stunned to see a well-preserved skull. These were the bones of a wooly mammoth that lived on the planet about 15,000 years ago. The multiton giant was approximately 40 years old when it died. Archaeologists found most of the animal‚Äôs skeleton, including the almost intact skull with tusks, though they did not find its limbs. Apparently, some hunters separated and took the limbs and put the mammoth‚Äôs body in storage. It is noteworthy that James exercised his right to keep some of the mammoth remains and gave most of the bones and the skull to a local museum. That was the first discovery, let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs next!",History

A note on 'Ivan the Terrible' - in Russia, Ivan IV has the epithet '–ì—Ä–æÃÅ–∑–Ω—ã–π' meaning 'Great' or 'Formidable'. So why is he known as Ivan 'the Terrible' in English? Because he was evil or useless or because of anti-Russian bias? No, because 'Terrible' in English also means awesome or formidable - this was well understood when '–ì—Ä–æÃÅ–∑–Ω—ã–π' was first translated into English centuries ago, but now fewer people understand this. (see definitions 3 & 4 here: ...). The name stuck, and Ivan IV has been known as Ivan the Terrible ever since.

1933,9UnQa0m8pQ,Reconquista - The Full History,"The history of the Reconquista was a 781 year medieval journey. It was the story of the Christian War of Reconquest against Islamic Spain. A struggle that was not always constant or consistent. The Christian kingdoms of the northern Iberian Peninsula held their ground, clinging to survival. In time, as the initiative shifted and the great Caliphate fell; Asturias, Leon, Castile, Navarre, Aragon, and Portugal would have the chance to press the offensive. They were hampered along the way by the Almoravids and later the Almohads - and of course fought amongst themselves. This video covers the full history up till the year 1212 and the famous Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa. As requested, all the individual parts were put together for this one continuous piece.

1938,2MZWH3mFG6Q,The Boxer Rebellion (1899-1901) | Project Revolution | History of China,"The Boxer Rebellion was the fourth and largest war, Imperial China fought against Western powers in the nineteenth century. Oddly enough, in its early stages, the Boxer movement was pitted against both Western influences in China and the Manchu-led Qing dynasty. The Qing Empress Dowager Cixi, however, saw the possibility to use these rebels for her own ends and managed to court its leaders in order to forge an anti-Western alliance... it turned out to be a bit of a misjudgment on her side, to put it mildly. The Boxer Rebellion served as a testament to the instability and chaos that pestered China and it definitely was one of the most interesting and tense episodes of Chinese history.

This video is part of Project Revolution: a collaboration with other history-oriented YouTube channels. Once you‚Äôve watched this video and want to know what transpired after the Boxer rebellion, I‚Äôd suggest you check out Emperor Tigerstar‚Äôs fascinating video about the Xinhai rebellion.

1954,xuaYPff-14,Mind-altering drugs: The magical history of LSD and mushrooms | Michael Pollan,"Why did government officials stop psychedelics from reaching mainstream culture?

- In the '60s drugs escape the lab and become a very important ingredient In the creation of the counterculture. Timothy Leary, a psychologist at Harvard in 1960, has something to do with this.

- In Cambridge, he starts the Harvard Psilocybin Project which focuses its research into learning more about this promising drug. Because of its medicinal properties, and apparent positive effect on mental health, Leary believed that everyone should use acid, or psilocybin.

- Richard Nixon called Leary the most dangerous man in America. He felt that LSD and other drugs were sapping the will of American boys to fight in Vietnam.

For the past twenty-five years, Michael Pollan has been writing books and articles about the places where nature and culture intersect: on our plates, in our farms and gardens, and in the built environment. His latest is How to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence - 

He is the author four New York Times bestsellers: Food Rules: An Eater‚Äôs Manual (2010); In Defense of Food: An Eater‚Äôs Manifesto (2008); The Omnivore‚Äôs Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals (2006) and The Botany of Desire: A Plant‚Äôs-Eye View of the World (2001). The Omnivore‚Äôs Dilemma was named one of the ten best books of 2006 by both the New York Times and the Washington Post. It also won the California Book Award, the Northern California Book Award, the James Beard Award, and was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award. A young readers edition called The Omnivore‚Äôs Dilemma: the Secrets Behind What You Eat was published in 2009. The Botany of Desire received the Borders Original Voices Award for the best non-fiction work of 2001, and was recognized as a best book of the year by the American Booksellers Association and Amazon.com. PBS premiered a two-hour special documentary based on The Botany of Desire in fall 2009.

10 most terrifying tortures in history
Boiling public opinion: 6-year-old baby tortured by her mother and mistress like an enemy
Horror: Tortured and burned because of suspected witch
""Rustic"" - Sitting wooden horse

When convicted of adultery, the woman was stripped of all her clothes and tied to a torture device with a saddle / donkey shape, in the middle there was a rough round wooden stick similar to the penis attached to the wheel shaft to move, some even get nailed around.


The wooden penis will be plugged into the vagina, when the horse runs, it will bump up on the vulva, causing the offender to bleed and suffer, and the victim will scream miserably.

Most people who are tortured in this form cannot escape death, and if they do, they will be disabled for life.

Hand clamps

This penalty was applied in Chinese feudal dynasties, which lasted until the end of Qing dynasty (19th century). This is also the most popular torture instrument for women during this period.

The woman suspected of adultery will have to put her fingers into a specialized tool for torture. This device will squeeze the victim's fingertip.

If it is too painful, the victim will faint, the cold water will be flushed to the province to continue suffering.

In addition, this form also appeared in Middle Eastern European countries with a device called ""hand grip"".

They are designed in all sizes to crush every part of the female body, from the hands, feet to the knees, even the head of the offender.

1958,LjMSvDFEeA,No Limits: Thalidomide Babies (Phocomelia) | History Documentary | Reel Truth History,"Oscar-winning documentary filmmaker John Zaritsky returns to the story that has fascinated and compelled him for years - thalidomide and it's effect on the survivors of ""the worst drug disaster in history."" In this, his third film on the subject, he reconnects with some of the thalidomide victims he originally profiled when they were young, and introduces us to some new people who have been active in the fight for justice. He also highlights some recently released information about German pharmaceutical giant Gr√ºnenthal, who aggressively marketed the drug, and are now selling it again under a different usage, but still with no compensation for those who's lives they affected so deeply. The indefatigable spirit of the extraordinary thalidomide victims is cast against the callousness disregard of the drug's manufacturers in a film that lays out the story from it's beginnings in the late 50s to the current state of affairs in the present day.

1964,dnV_MTFEGIY,The Atlantic Slave Trade: Crash Course World History #24,"In which John Green teaches you about one of the least funny subjects in history: slavery. John investigates when and where slavery originated, how it changed over the centuries, and how Europeans and colonists in the Americas arrived at the idea that people could own other people based on skin color. 

Slavery has existed as long as humans have had civilization, but the Atlantic Slave Trade was the height, or depth, of dehumanizing, brutal, chattel slavery. American slavery ended less than 150 years ago. In some parts of the world, it is still going on. So how do we reconcile that with modern life? In a desperate attempt at comic relief, Boba Fett makes an appearance.

1972,DoIQdQ9Mo5E,Lady Jane Grey (England's Forgotten Queen) | History Documentary | Reel Truth History,"Lady Jane Grey became a Tudor Queen after the dying King Edward VI, the only son of Henry VIII left her the throne. Now, historian Helen Castor explores the tragic story of Lady Jane Grey and investigates how her terrible fate, on the block in the Tower of London, was sealed as soon as she was drawn into the line of succession. 

In 1553 Tudor England, Wales and Ireland is taken to the brink of a bloody civil war when the dying King Edward VI, son of Henry VIII, leaves the throne, not to his elder sister, Mary, but to his cousin, the Lady Jane Grey.

This is a story of intrigue, conspiracy, political manoeuvring and a capital city preparing to be attacked. It is also the story of a young woman, ferociously manipulated by powerful men in the palace, who ends up losing her life as a result.

The life of Lady Jane Grey is a tragic narrative. From the moment Edward VI draws Jane into the line of succession, her terrible fate, on the block in the Tower of London, is sealed.
Helen Castor is a historian and a medievalist who has studied the She Wolves, those women who held power in various ways throughout the medieval period. Now she sets out to take a close look at the first woman to sit on the English throne, not as consort, but as a reigning Queen. But Helen discovers far more than a story about a Tudor Queen. The story of Jane Grey is surrounded by myth, confusion and propaganda. Images turn out not to be Jane, well known stories turn out to be fake and many of the books disagree on the details. Helen asks why the first woman to be proclaimed Queen of England has attracted so much bending of the truth.

Helen undertakes some Tudor detective work and turns back to the primary sources in an attempt to separate the truth from the fiction. She builds the real story of Jane Grey and those dark figures that surrounded her, tracing her world, and the nine days she spent on the throne.

1973,xy_M4pDjaf,Catholic Counter-Reformation: Crash Course European History #9,"When the Protestant Reformation broke out in Western Europe, the Catholic Church got the message, at least a little bit. Pope Paul III called a council to look into reforming some aspects of the Catholic Church and try to stem the tide of competing Christian sects popping up all over the place. The Council of Trent changed some aspects of the organization, but doubled down on a lot  of the practices that Martin Luther and other reformers had a problem with. Today you'll learn about the Council of Trent, the rise of the Jesuits, and Saint Teresa of Avila.

Subscribe to TheSportster http://goo.gl/mZKUfd

When it comes to the length of wrestling matches, there‚Äôs rarely a limit. Once in a while a cap is placed on the amount of time allowed, and obviously televised matches need to fit within a designated timeslot, but most of the time, wrestlers are able to continue grappling until someone is pinned and a winner is declared.

However, on the other end of the spectrum, the shortest amount of time possible for a wrestling match is three seconds - just enough time for the referee to count off the pin. Through distractions, quickly gained advantages, and devastating finishers, a couple matches have actually lasted for only the minimum length, with a number of other notable bouts coming quite close. Here are the 10 shortest matches in WWE history.

1998,LIZE1x4IGNk,"STEWART SWERDLOW ~ ""Secret Galactic History - Mind Control & Occult Sexual Magic"" [Age Of Truth TV]","Dr. Rev. STEWART A. SWERDLOW has already become rather legendary within the field of conspiracy and truth research, and is known for his decade-long work to expose the truth as he sees it, and enlighten people in the field of alternative science, spirituality, therapy, mind control deprogramming and truth research.

This new AGE OF TRUTH TV production features Stewart Swerdlow in an in-depth hard-talk conversation with AOT TV presenter and interviewer, Lucas Alexander.

A famous survivor of the dreaded and infamous MONTAUK PROJECT, Stewart Swerdlow was one of the so-called Montauk Boys, who were put under Mind Control experimentation and compartmentalisation along with being used for Occult Sexual Magic at Satanic Rituals performed by dignitaries and elitists at the Montauk Military Base on Long Island, New York.  Stewart Swerdlow is an experiencer of Extra-Terrestrials and according to himself, been part of alien experiments. He witnessed seeing Reptilian and Greys aliens, and claims that these aliens are working with the Deep State Military factions of the U.S. Government and Governments around the world.

At Montauk, Swerdlow was told and taught a very alternative and different version of WORLD HISTORY and our galactic and alien connection, which he claims is the true history of the world. It is a fascinating and mind-blowing tale of our universe, the galaxy, the history of the Earth, the Moon and the planets in our solar system. What really happened and why are we told a completely ""wrong"" version of the origin of life and Earths civilisations? Stewart Swerdlow go into details about this secret knowledge, which is intensely eye-opening.

SELECTED TOPICS DISCUSSED:

-  Swerdlows Soviet, Communist and KGB Family History and 
   bloodline.
- THE MONTAUK PROJECT (Swerdlow as one of the ""Montauk Boys"").
- Aliens / Extra-Terrestrials / Inter-Dimensional entities and races:
  REPTILIANS, GREYS, NORDICS, ANNUNAKI, INSECTOIDS etc.
- The Galactic Alien connection to Planet Earth and alternative history.
- The MOON, SATURN, MARS - PLANET MALDEK and NIBURU.
- The ILLUMINATI and The New World Order Global Government 
  Agenda.
- Satanism, SATANIC RITUALS and the sinister ""reason"" behind 
  sacrifices!
- 5G and the A.I - Artificial Intelligence DNA human take-over.
- The CERN Agenda and the Notr√© Dame fire in Paris.
- WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE DIE (the reincarnation soul trap).
- Religions and the Vatican.

......all this and much much more as Stewart Swerdlow takes you on a extraordinary journey into the unknown, questioned in a dynamic interview/conversation with Age Of Truth TV presenter Lucas Alexander.

Agora (Spanish: √Ågora) is a 2009 Spanish English-language historical drama film directed by Alejandro Amen√°bar and written by Amen√°bar and Mateo Gil. The biopic stars Rachel Weisz as Hypatia, a female mathematician, philosopher and astronomer in late 4th-century Roman Egypt, who investigates the flaws of the geocentric Ptolemaic system and the heliocentric model that challenges it. Surrounded by religious turmoil and social unrest, Hypatia struggles to save the knowledge of classical antiquity from destruction. Max Minghella co-stars as Davus, Hypatia's father's slave, and Oscar Isaac as Hypatia's student, and later prefect of Alexandria, Orestes.

The story uses historical fiction to highlight the relationship between religion and science amidst the decline of Greco-Roman polytheism and the Christianization of the Roman Empire. The title of the film takes its name from the agora, a gathering place in ancient Greece, similar to the Roman forum. The film was produced by Fernando Bovaira and shot on the island of Malta from March to June 2008. Justin Pollard, co-author of The Rise and Fall of Alexandria (2007), was the historical adviser for the film.

Agora was screened out of competition at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival in May, and opened in Spain on October 9, 2009 becoming the highest grossing film of the year for that country. Although the film had difficulty finding distribution, it was released country by country throughout late 2009 and early 2010. The film received a 53% overall approval rating from Rotten Tomatoes and seven Goya Awards in Spain, including Best Original Screenplay. It was awarded the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Feature Film Prize at the Hamptons International Film Festival.",History

5. Van Gogh Cut off Ear
While in school, learning about famous artists, we all know that Van Gogh was simply a mad man who sliced off his ear and mailed it to his lover, right? Who would really inflict that much physical pain on themselves over an ex? After looking through quite a few letters and it seems more than likely that him and a friend of his got into a scuffle involving too much French wine and a sword. Which normally don‚Äôt mix too well. Van Gogh was certainly no snitch and didn‚Äôt want to report the incident that could potentially put his best friend in prison. 

4. Sphinx Nose
How did the Sphinx lose it‚Äôs nose? Did it get a bad Rhinoplasty?  Or was While Napoleon was invading Egypt, he used the nose as a target practice for his cannons. This is another absurd historical legend that many still might believe. The nose was gone centuries before Napoleon was even born. Napoleon was fascinated with Egyptology and sought to preserve egypt‚Äôs antiquities. The limestone used to construct the sphinx eroded fairly quickly after a few thousand years had gone by. But Egypt is a Muslim country where worshipping idols is not permitted and it‚Äôs still a wonder how this monument is still here. Historical accounts from the 1400‚Äôs say that a religious islamist leader, Muhammad Sa‚Äôim al Dahr, destroyed the nose when he saw people worshipping the sphinx as an idol. 

3. Vikings Horned Helmets
Archaeologists have a better chance of finding a unicorn than finding a horned viking helmet. Even the football team the Vikings, have horns on their helmet. This is just a modern day myth and an artist's portrayal of how the vikings actually looks while in battle. Thiss portrayal began in the 1800‚Äôs when scandinavians artists such as Malmstrom and Mary McGregor included this style of helmet, like we see in this illustration of Leif Ericsson discovering Vineland. Horned helmets did exist but these were over a couple thousand of years ago during the bronze age and used for ritualistic religious ceremonies

2. Stonehenge
One of the biggest ancient mysteries in the world is certainly stonehenge and they‚Äôve been standing in that formation for 5000 years. Oh no don‚Äôt tell me this is a lie too. Could this all be some kind of cruel hoax? Historical records of the monument date back to about 1200 AD but it‚Äôs highly doubtful that they‚Äôve been in the same position we see them today.  A curator from Cambridge University quoted,‚ÄùNearly all the stones we see today have been moved in some way and are standing in concrete.‚Äù This image we see here shows stonehenge in 1877 with stones leaning on eachother. Many monuments around the world must be restored at some point. This photo here shows some type of restoration project going on in 1898 with two men on top of a block that looks like it‚Äôs being placed there with a crane.  This photo shows the crane picking up the block and you can clearly tell this is a massive restoration project. Take a look at the photos and let us know what you believe. 

1. First Thanksgiving
Sorry Guys, American eye has to ruin thanksgiving for you too. And there‚Äôs absolutely no truth to this one besides the feast itself and what we celebrate couldn‚Äôt be anything further from the truth! As a kid you might have believed your teacher saying that thanksgiving was a friendly celebration between Indians and Pilgrims who came together and feasted on Turkey legs and corn, sharing farming secrets. Thanksgiving was basically a celebration after a vengeful retaliation on native americans and it was celebrated around the same time each year. We won‚Äôt get into all the details but if you know how history tended to go between European settlers and Native Americans, you can probably take a good guess. Anyways, don‚Äôt let it keep you from enjoying some stuffing and turkey, which the pilgrims never ate",History

2016,2bSy-thgssM,Zeitgeist: Addendum (Peter Joseph) | History Documentary | Reel Truth History,"Zeitgeist: Addendum was born out of public interest in possible solutions to the cultural issues presented in Zeitgeist: The Movie. Building upon the topics of social distortion and corruption, Addendum moves to also present possible solutions. Featured in the work is former ‚ÄúEconomic Hit-man‚Äù and New York Times bestselling author, John Perkins, along with The Venus Project, an organisation for social redesign created by Social Engineer and Industrial Designer Jacque Fresco. Part One explains the process of Money Creation and Expansion through the Fractional Reserve System. It explains how Debt and Bankruptcy are not mere byproducts of our current system, but rather are underlying realities of our existence with periodic failures guaranteed. Part Two exposes various levels of international corruption via the financial/corporate system, including the manipulation of public leaders to further the interests of corporate institutions.

2023,B9YtgV7R4q,History Channel - Civilization Lost - Full History Documentary,"Around the world, archaeologists are uncovering artifacts that suggest the existence of previously unknown ancient civilizations, much like the mythical city of Atlantis. 

There is a growing belief among certain scientists and archaeologists that tens of thousands of years ago, before the rise of today's man, sophisticated human societies populated large cities that possibly featured mechanized transportation, electricity, and advanced weapons systems. Proponents of this theory believe that these civilizations were wiped off the planet and that the evidence now lies buried miles beneath the Earth's surface. This two-hour special will investigate these beliefs and uncover the truth about people who lived before the beginning of recorded time.

I trace my own ancestry to the days of the British Empire, when my family were planters in Ceylon. I meet a long lost relative from the Congreve family and I even find 19th century photos of my ancestor Norman Rowsell hung up in a Victorian sports pavilion called the Darrawella Club. 
The British Empire is viewed in the context of civilisational cycles and I explain author John Still's theory of the Jungle Tide and the jungle gods that are still worshipped here. Tea and the modern tea industry of Sri Lanka that was founded under the British Empire, is here used as a device by which the viewer can look at the history of that country and understand the impermanent and fragile nature of all civilisation.

2027,6pxxS07PZn0,In Search Of History - Charles Ponzi & His Scheme (History Channel Documentary),"This episode was converted from an old VHS tape that had considerable wear and tear, resulting in poor audio quality. Unfortunately it's the only copy I've been able to obtain so far.
__________________________
Narrated by David Ackroyd

Charles Ponzi became known in the early 1920s as a swindler in North America for his money-making scheme. He promised clients a 50% profit within 45 days, or 100% profit within 90 days, by buying discounted postal reply coupons in other countries and redeeming them at face value in the United States as a form of arbitrage. 

In reality, Ponzi was paying earlier investors using the investments of later investors. His scheme ran for over a year before it collapsed, costing his ""investors"" $20 million.

While this type of fraudulent investment scheme was not originally invented by Ponzi, it became so identified with him that it now is referred to as a Ponzi scheme.

2034,kk5-ynRPf,A History of Britain - The Humans Arrive (1 Million BC - 8000 BC),"In this first episode we go back to the very beginning of human life of Britain.

Note: The exact identity of the human species found at Happisburgh is a little more up in the air than this video makes it sound. Currently academic consensus looks to be moving towards Homo antecessor as the correct identity, however the stone tools found at Pakefield and Boxgrove are almost certainly from Homo heidelbergensis. This was simplified to Homo heidelbergensis in the video for the sake of brevity. Homo heidelbergensis may also have been ambush predators on top of scavengers and fishers.

2038,QZxpU,The Biggest Scandals To Ever Hit The History Channel,"Back when the internet was young and facts still had meaning, there was the History Channel, featuring shows about - you guessed it - history. But that version of the network is long gone today. Here are the biggest scandals to hit the reality TV outlet that's now simply called History.
Ice Road Truckers is one of History's best-known reality shows, depicting the perilous lives of drivers in the iciest regions of Canada and Alaska. And sure, it's been criticized by actual trucker media like Truck News for exaggerating or even faking some of the danger.
But real scandal hit the show in 2013. According to a CBS report, star Tim Zickuhr abducted Lisa Cadeau after hiring her for escort work in Las Vegas. He claimed she overcharged him by $1,000 and demanded she meet him to settle the dispute. It was then that he dragged her back to his apartment, beat her, and tied her up in a closet.
Fearing for her life, Cadeau gave Zickuhr the phone number of an undercover police officer, claiming he could pay her ransom. Zickuhr called the number and unknowingly arranged his own arrest. The Las Vegas Sun reported Zickuhr confessed on the spot that he intended to hold Cadeau hostage and prostitute her through Craigslist.

Thanks to his mother's support, John Snow rose from humble beginnings as a coal miner's son and apprenticed to a doctor in Newcastle. As a young man, he treated many patients during the cholera epidemic that struck Newcastle. He noticed that the traditional explanation for cholera's spread - miasma from graveyards and swamps - could not explain its appearance in Newcastle where he treated patients. He took that knowledge with him to London, where he formally studied medicine and achieved the highest honors in his profession in only a year. His formal study of anesthesia earned him such great recognition that on two occasions he was trusted to work on the Queen. But then cholera broke out in London again. Snow wanted to prove miasma didn't cause it and find the real cause, so he interviewed patients and doctors across the city. He theorized that the diarrhea which came from cholera also helped to spread it. He even wrote up a case study where one street whose well water mixed with sewage had a huge infection rate while across the street their neighbors with pure well water barely suffered at all. Confident that he had found the cause, he published his findings, but the medical community was not thoroughly convinced.

They came into contact with the Romans, who ruled the entire peninsula for over four centuries until the late 300s CE. They were replaced with various Germanic kingdoms, who were in turn replaced by the Islamic Caliphate. What followed was a gradual reconquest of the area, which had been completed by 1492. After a strengthening of the union of Castile and Aragon in 1516, Iberia took a form roughly similar to today.

Saving Private Ryan is a 1998 American epic war drama film set during the Invasion of Normandy in World War II. Directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Robert Rodat, the film is notable for its graphic portrayal of war, and for the intensity of its opening 27 minutes, which includes a depiction of the Omaha Beach assault of June 6, 1944. It follows United States Army Rangers Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) and a squad (Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg, and Jeremy Davies) as they search for a paratrooper, Private First Class James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), who is the last-surviving brother of four servicemen.

The film received universal critical acclaim, winning several awards for film, cast, and crew, as well as earning significant returns at the box office. The film grossed US$481.8 million worldwide, making it the second highest-grossing film of the year. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominated the film for 11 Academy Awards; Spielberg's direction won him a second Academy Award for Best Director, with four more awards going to the film. Saving Private Ryan was released on home video in May 1999, earning another $44 million from sales. In 2014, Saving Private Ryan was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry as it was deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.""",History

Lyrics

Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning
She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I been holdin' on too tight
With nothing in between
The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time
Is frozen (the story of, the story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
Written on these walls are
The colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open
But it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning now
I see us in the light upon a hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed, still
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
The way that I've been holdin' on so tight
With nothing in between
The story of my life, I'll take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time
Is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
And I've been waiting for this time to come around
But, baby, running after you is like chasing the clouds
The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm and time
Is frozen
The story of my life, I give her hope (give her hope)
I spend her love until she's broken inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life

2067,Ot-acn1whr,The Coming War On China (China Documentary) | History Documentary | Reel Truth History,"The Coming War on China, from award winning journalist John Pilger, reveals what the news doesn‚Äôt ‚Äì that the world‚Äôs greatest military power, the United States, and the world‚Äôs second economic power, China, both nuclear-armed, may well be on the road to war. 

Nuclear war is not only imaginable, but planned. The greatest build-up of NATO military forces since the Second World War is under way on the western borders of Russia. On the other side of the world, the rise of China is viewed in Washington as a threat to American dominance. 

To counter this, President Obama announced a ‚Äòpivot to Asia‚Äô, which meant that almost two-thirds of all US naval forces would be transferred to Asia and the Pacific, their weapons aimed at China. A policy which has been taken up by his successor Donald Trump, who during his election campaign said ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt continue to allow China to rape our country and that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre doing‚Äù.

Filmed on five possible front-lines across Asia and the Pacific over two years, the story is told in chapters that connect a secret and ‚Äòforgotten‚Äô past to the rapacious actions of great power today and to a resistance, of which little is known in the West.

Muhammad Nizamuddin Auliya (Urdu: ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ŸÜÿ∏ÿßŸÖ ÿßŸÑÿØŸë€åŸÜ ÿßŸàŸÑ€åÿßÿ°; sometimes spelled Awliya; 1238 ‚Äì 3 April 1325), also known as Hazrat Nizamuddin, was a Sufi saint of the Chishti Order and arguably one of the most famous Sufis on the Indian Subcontinent.[1] His predecessors were Fariduddin Ganjshakar, Qutbuddin Bakhtiyar Kaki and Moinuddin Chishti. In that sequence, they constitute the initial spiritual chain or silsila of the Chishti order, widely prevalent in the Indian subcontinent.

Nizamuddin Auliya, like his predecessors, stressed love as a means of realising God. For him his love of God implied a love of humanity. His vision of the world was marked by a highly evolved sense of religious pluralism and kindness.[2] It is claimed by the 14th century historiographer Ziauddin Barani that his influence on the Muslims of Delhi was such that a paradigm shift was effected in their outlook towards worldly matters. People began to be inclined towards mysticism and prayers and remaining aloof from the world.

____________

With no written records from the Zulus themselves, historians and anthropologists have pieced together their history from a smattering of sources. We first learn of the Zulu as a minor tribe of the Bantu people, living in South Africa. Shaka Zulu, the man who would organize them into an empire, was born the illegitimate son of a Zulu king. He was sent away with his mother Nandi to grow up in her tribe, the Langeni, but he eventually caught the attention of Dingiswayo, the leader of another powerful tribe called the Mtethwa. Appointed as the leader of a squadron called an ibutho, Shaka developed new tactics including a short ""iklwa"" fighting spear and a simple but effective military maneuever called ""the Bull Horn."" When his father died, Shaka - now a successful military leader - returned with Dingiswayo's backing to assassinate the rightful heir and assume control of his native tribe. Just a year later, though, the neighboring Ndwandwe tribe murdered Dingiswayo and Shaka vowed revenge on their leader, Zwide. He then launched a bloody war that, combined with the strains created by European colonization, led to the Mefacane, or the Crushing.

By contrast, very little attention is given to how to spend money well ‚Äì by which we mean, in ways that stand a chance of properly increasing our sense of well-being and therefore justifying the sacrifices that went into earning the cash.

In which John Green teaches you about the Cold War as it unfolded in Asia. As John pointed out last week, the Cold War was occasionally hot, and a lot of that heat was generated in Asia. This is starting to sound weird with the hot/cold thing, so let's just say that the United States struggle against communist expansion escalated to full-blown, boots on the ground war in Korea and Vietnam. In both of these cases, the United States sent soldiers to intervene in civil wars that it looked like communists might win. That's a bit of a simplification, but John will explain it all to you.

European powers started to create colonial empires way back in the 16th century, but businesses really took off in the 19th century, especially in Asia and Africa. During the 1800s, European powers carved out spheres of influence in China, India, and pretty much all of Africa. While all of the major (and some minor) powers in Europe participated  in this new imperialism, England was by far the most dominant, once able to claim that the ""sun never set on the British Empire."" Also, they went to war for the right to continue to sell opium to the people of China. Twice. John will teach you how these empires managed to leverage the advances of the Industrial Revolution to build vast, wealth-generating empires. As it turns out, improved medicine, steam engines, and better guns were crucial in the 19th century conquests. Also, the willingness to exploit and abuse the people and resources of so-called ""primitive"" nations was very helpful in the whole enterprise.

In which John Green teaches you about the Cold War, which was the decades long conflict between the USA and the USSR. The Cold War was called cold because of the lack of actual fighting, but this is inaccurate. There was plenty of fighting, from Korea to Viet Nam to Afghanistan, but we'll get into that stuff next week. This week we'll talk about how the Cold War started. In short it grew out of World War II. Basically, the Soviets occupied eastern Europe, and the US supported western Europe. This setup would spill across the world, with client states on both sides. It's all in the video. You should just watch it.

Research-based reconstructions certainly bring forth such an advantage with their provision of ‚Äòglimpses‚Äô into the past. And among them, facial reconstructions of actual historical characters rather notch it up a level, with their ability to tantalizingly satisfy our inherent curiosity about the ‚Äòplayers‚Äô in the grander scheme of things.

After effects, Illustrator, Premier Pro, Audacity, Yeti microphone,

2106,dC_2WXyORGA,A History of Earth's Climate,"Earth had a climate long before we showed up and started noticing it and it's influenced by a whole series of cycles that have been churning along for hundreds of millions of years. In most cases those cycles will continue long after we're gone. A look at the history of climate change on Earth can give us some much needed perspective on our current climate dilemma because the surprising truth is, what we're experiencing now is different than anything this planet has encountered before. So, let's take a stroll down Climate History Lane and see if we can find some answers to a question that's been bugging Hank a lot lately - just how much hot water are we in?

I'd lean more toward horrifying and depressing institution, but nobody asked me. John will talk about what life was like for a slave in the 19th century United States, and how slaves resisted oppression, to the degree that was possible. We'll hear about cotton plantations, violent punishment of slaves, day to day slave life, and slave rebellions. Nat Turner, Harriet Tubman, and Whipped Peter all make an appearance. Slavery as an institution is arguably the darkest part of America's history, and we're still dealing with its aftermath 150 years after it ended. Support CrashCourse on Patreon:

2116,kcl98aBRkD8,The Unfortunate History of the AMC Pacer - Documentary Film,"Behind all the jokes and insults, the AMC Pacer is actually a car with a great deal of history.  It began as radical new design from an underdog company.  In an attempt to combat the big, bland, boxy cars from Detroit's ""Big Three,"" little American Motors Corporation decided to build something a little different.  Their one-eyed car stylist Dick Teague proposed a small, wide car with big windows and smooth aerodynamics.  Americans had never seen anything like it.
 This in-depth documentary tells the true story of the Pacer.  Unbeknownst to many, the car persevered through manufacturing setbacks, government regulations, and many other troubles.  Featuring a ton of old car advertisements and rare footage of AMC's factory, the film helps paint a picture of the Pacer's world.  Director Joe Ligo sits down with AMC stylist Vincent Geraci, author Patrick Foster, and television personalities John Davis and Pat Goss from PBS's MotorWeek.",History

1492 Conquest of Paradise - 

Braveheart is a 1995 historical drama epic film directed by and starring Mel Gibson. Gibson portrays William Wallace, a 13th-century Scottish warrior who led the Scots in the First War of Scottish Independence against King Edward I of England. The story is based on Blind Harry's epic poem The Actes and Deidis of the Illustre and Vallyeant Campioun Schir William Wallace and was adapted for the screen by Randall Wallace.

The film was nominated for ten Academy Awards at the 68th Academy Awards and won five: Best Picture, Best Makeup, Best Cinematography, Best Sound Editing, and Best Director.

Randall Wallace, who wrote the screenplay, has acknowledged Blind Harry's 15th century epic poem The Acts and Deeds of Sir William Wallace, Knight of Elderslie as a major inspiration for the film.[26] In defending his script, Randall Wallace has said, ""Is Blind Harry true? I don't know. I know that it spoke to my heart and that's what matters to me, that it spoke to my heart.""[26] Blind Harry's poem is now not regarded as historically accurate, and although some incidents in the film which are not historically accurate are taken from Blind Harry (e.g. the hanging of Scottish nobles at the start), [27] there are large parts which are based neither on history nor Blind Harry (e.g. Wallace's affair with Princess Isabelle).

Elizabeth Ewan describes Braveheart as a film which ""almost totally sacrifices historical accuracy for epic adventure"".[28] The ""brave heart"" refers in Scottish history to that of Robert the Bruce, and an attribution by William Edmondstoune Aytoun, in his poem Heart of Bruce, to Sir James the Good Douglas: ""Pass thee first, thou dauntless heart, As thou wert wont of yore!"", prior to Douglas' demise at the Battle of Teba in Andalusia.[29] It has been described as one of the most historically inaccurate modern films.[30]

Sharon Krossa notes that the film contains numerous historical errors, beginning with the wearing of belted plaid by Wallace and his men. In that period ""no Scots ... wore belted plaids (let alone kilts of any kind)."" Moreover, when Highlanders finally did begin wearing the belted plaid, it was not ""in the rather bizarre style depicted in the film"". She compares the inaccuracy to ""a film about Colonial America showing the colonial men wearing 20th century business suits, but with the jackets worn back-to-front instead of the right way around.""[31] ""The events aren't accurate, the dates aren't accurate, the characters aren't accurate, the names aren't accurate, the clothes aren't accurate‚Äîin short, just about nothing is accurate.""[32] The belted plaid (feileadh m√≥r l√©ine) was not introduced until the 16th century.[33] Peter Traquair has referred to Wallace's ""farcical representation as a wild and hairy highlander painted with woad (1,000 years too late) running amok in a tartan kilt (500 years too early)."" [34]

In 2009, the film was second on a list of ""most historically inaccurate movies"" in The Times.[30] In the humorous non-fictional historiography An Utterly Impartial History of Britain (2007), author John O'Farrell notes that Braveheart could not have been more historically inaccurate, even if a ""Plasticine dog"" had been inserted in the film and the title changed to William Wallace and Gromit.",History

A note on 'Ivan the Terrible' - in Russia, Ivan IV has the epithet '–ì—Ä–æÃÅ–∑–Ω—ã–π', which means 'Great' or 'Formidable'. So why is he called Ivan 'the Terrible' in this video? Because he was evil or useless? No, it is because '–ì—Ä–æÃÅ–∑–Ω—ã–π' was first translated into English many years ago as 'Terrible', when the word commonly meant awesome or formidable (see definitions 3 & 4 here: ). And in English, Ivan IV has been known as Ivan the Terrible ever since.

During the fourteenth century the Renaissance started in Italy, and slowly spread throughout Europe. As shown in this episode, the refreshing Renaissance era indicates an intellectual, philosophical, artistic and religious revolution and is mainly influenced by humanism. The objective of this movement to improve humanity also had its effect on the kitchen and dinner table. Strict table manners and consumption of imported vegetables are examples of the many culinary changes discussed in the episode.

1.  Beirut is in Lebanon, not Syria.

2.  At the time of the Roman Empire, Great Britain would have been known as Britannia rather than England.  The name ""England"" was first used during the Middle Ages, referring to the tribe of Germanic Angles that settled the island after the fall of the Roman Empire.

3.  Our Lady of Guadalupe is the only Marian apparition in the Americas to have been approved by the Holy See.  Other Marian apparitions in the Americas have been approved by local ordinaries, including Our Lady of Good Success in Ecuador (1572),  Our Lady of Good Help in Wisconsin (1859), Our Lady of Cuapa in Nicaragua (1980), in Venezuela (1984) and Our Lady of the Rosary of San Nicolas in Argentina (1980s).

2140,kcfKaC87r4,"American History Textbooks' Lies: Everything Your Teacher Got Wrong - Myths, Education (1995)","Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong is a 1995 book by sociologist James W. Loewen. More about the book: 

It critically examines twelve American history textbooks and concludes that textbook authors propagate factually false, Eurocentric, and mythologized views of history. In addition to critiquing the dominant historical themes presented in textbooks, Loewen presents a number of his own historical themes that he says are ignored by traditional history textbooks. A newly revised and updated hardcover edition was released on April 1, 2008. The New Press lists Lies My Teacher Told Me as its top all-time bestseller.

In Lies My Teacher Told Me, Loewen criticizes modern American history textbooks for containing incorrect information about people and events such as Christopher Columbus, the lies and inaccuracies in the history books regarding the dealings between the Europeans and the Native Americans, and their often deceptive and inaccurate teachings told about America's commerce in slavery. He further criticizes the texts for a tendency to avoid controversy and for their ""bland"" and simplistic style. He proposes that when American history textbooks elevate American historical figures to the status of heroes, they unintentionally give students the impression that these figures are superhumans who live in the irretrievable past. In other words, the history-as-myth method teaches students that America's greatest days have already passed. Loewen asserts that the muting of past clashes and tragedies makes history boring to students, especially groups excluded from the positive histories.

The twelve textbooks Loewen examined for the first edition are:
The American Adventure (1975)
American Adventures (1987)
American History (1982)
The American Pageant (1991)
The American Tradition (1984)
The American Way (1979)
The Challenge of Freedom (1990)
Discovering American History (1974)
Land of Promise (1983)
Life and Liberty (1984)
Triumph of the American Nation (1986)
The United States: A History of the Republic (1991)
In the second edition, Loewen added six more books; including a newer edition of The American Pageant:
The American Journey (2000)
The American Pageant (2006)
The Americans (2007)
America: Pathways to the Present (2005)
A History of the United States (2005)
Holt American Nation (2003)

Lies my Teacher Told Me is the winner of the 1996 American Book Award,[3] the Oliver Cromwell Cox Award for Distinguished Anti-Racist Scholarship, and the Critics Choice Award of the American Educational Studies Association. Sundown Towns was named one of ten Distinguished Books of 2005 by the Gustavus Myers Foundation.
Conservative activist David Horowitz has criticized some of Loewen's assertions for their partiality and inaccuracy, in particular questioning Loewen's claims about the relationship between American Indians and Columbus.

Lesbian relationship isn‚Äôt something that surprises people anymore. If couples have to hide even in 2017, what must it have been like a few years ago, when the LGBT community didn't understand their sexuality themselves? The LGBT community owes a lot to the men and women who came before them, knew how society felt about them, and yet, chose to love a member of the same sex openly.

10. Josephine Baker
Josephine Baker (1906 ‚Äì 1975) American-born French dancer, singer, and actor, was known by many monikers, such as the ‚ÄúBlack Pearl,‚Äù ‚ÄúBronze Venus,‚Äù and ‚ÄúCreole Goddess.‚Äù She was the first black woman to star in a major film, Zouzou. She married four times, and her adopted son Jean-Claude Baker describes his mother as a bisexual, and recalled his mother as having many ‚Äúlady lovers.‚Äù

9. Frida Kahlo
Frida Kahlo de Rivera (1907 ‚Äì 1954), was a Mexican painter known for her self-portraits. Much has been written about Kahlo, with her works being celerated by feminists for its depiction of the female experience and form. 

8. Amrita Sher-Gill
Amrita Sher-Gil (1913 ‚Äì1941) was an eminent Indian painter, sometimes known as India's Frida Kahlo. Her affairs with men and women were quite well known, with her using some of them as models for her work. In fact, her work Two Women is considered to be a painting of herself with her lover Marie Louise.

7. Billie Jean King
Billie Jean King (born November 22, 1943) is an American former World No. 1 professional tennis player. She was the first prominent female athlete to reveal her sexuality, when details of her affair with her secretary, Marilyn Barnett, was made public.

6. Virginia Woolf
Adeline Virginia Woolf (1882 ‚Äì 1941) was an English writer and one of the foremost modernists of the twentieth century. Woolf had a passionate relationship with Vita Sackville-West. This relationship inspired one of Woolf's most famous novels, Orlando , featuring the life of a poet who changes sex from man to woman over centuries, meeting the key figures of English literary history.

5. Audre Lorde
Audre Lorde (1934 ‚Äì 1992) was a black writer, feminist, womanist, and civil rights activist. She described herself as a ‚Äúblack, lesbian, mother, warrior, poet,‚Äù and was known for her activist work with Afro-German women in the 1980s.

4. Barbara Gittings
Barbara Gittings (1932 ‚Äì 2007) was a prominent American activist for gay equality. Gittings served as the President of the New York chapter of the Daughters of Bilitis, picketed the White House in the 1960s to let the world know how easily homosexuals could be fired simply on the basis of their sexual orientation.

3. Jane Addams
Jane Addams known as the ""mother"" of Social Work (1860 ‚Äì 1935) was a pioneer American settlement activist/reformer, social worker, sociologist, author, and leader in women's suffrage and world peace. She co-founded Hull House in 1889 with her first romantic partner Ellen Gates Starr. Addams was later in a relationship with Mary Rozet Smith, who was financially sound, and supported Addams's work at Hull House. Addams won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931.

2. Queen Christina of Sweden
Christina (1626 ‚Äì 1689) reigned as Queen of Sweden from 1632 to 1654. Queen Christina rejected the role of a woman, which was simply to provide an heir, by announcing that she did not intend to marry. Modern biographers generally consider her to have been a lesbian, with many affairs with women noted during her life. 
Sources have found passionate letters to Ebba Sparre, and she was supposed to have had relationships with Gabrielle de Rochechouart de Mortemart, Rachel, a niece of Diego Teixeira and the singer Angelina Giorgino.

1. Sappho
Sappho (c. 630 ‚Äì c. 570 BC) was an archaic Greek poet from the island of Lesbos. The word ‚Äúlesbian‚Äù is literally derived from the Greek island of Lesbos, where Sappho was born. Sappho's poetry was lyric poetry, and she is best known for her poems about love. Her poems spoke of the infatuations and love, both requited and unrequited, she felt for other women.

Magic Weed : The Truth About Cannabis Sativa traces the story of the Cannabis plant, which has been known to mankind for thousands of years and how it serves us in so many ways. The sacred herb was always seen by Shamans and the ancients as a gift from the Creator God(s) of life on Earth. Like food nourishes the body, Cannabis provides nourishment for the mind and works it‚Äôs magic with the soul.

Meaning the original people groups of Europe that inhabited the landmass before the arrival of the Indo-Europeans, a group which would later evolve into the vast majority of European nations we see today, from the Russians, Italians, Irish, Norwegians and Greeks.

Although precious little is known, there are clues left behind in the archaeology, genetics, linguistics and historical texts that have been passed down through the generations, which gives us a somewhat fuzzy picture of pre-historic Europe. Be sure to let me know your thoughts on the pre-Indo-European Europeans and let me know which culture you think is the most interesting. Thanks for watching!

2176,Jzl9Q3g35,PHILIPPINES: The Hidden History of Ancient Kingdoms and Empires,"-This video is not an Anti-Hispanic culture documentary and doesn't aim to abolished Hispanic/American culture in Philippines, I think it's important to remember that we need to appreciate every collective culture that history has throwned to the islands of the Philippines, for it would be a monument of the richness of the country, to remind every Filipinos that many great nations with different cultures of the world have fought for it's richness but in the end it was taken back by the Filipino people, and the Filipino people alone. That way they can feel a sense of uniqueness among the other Asian cultures! i don't want this video to be misunderstood

plus it could make Spain and America get away with everything they did while colonizing The Philippines, if Filipinos just erase the culture as if that part of history never happened. 

I personally saw it happening today. Some Spanish or even Mexican and Americans people today are rejecting the fact that they did colonized Philippines at all. Why? because Filipinos are destroying every evidence of it from their cultures and architectures[for more info watch:  ] thinking they belong to Asia when that is not the case! 
Colonial era is already part of Philippine history! and no matter what, history will never change! European cultures is already passed to Philippines and you cannot forced it not to.

Colonial history is the only part of history that has a direct contact with the pre-colonial era as it is the sequel of the story,...  if the rejection of colonial evidence(demolishing many heritage cities instead of rebuilding a replicating it) still continues, even history of colonization might even be rejected as a myth and this is very possible.

This Video only aims to let them appreicate the lost Pre-Hispanic cultures too.

The Lost History of Ancient Philippine Kingdoms and Empires, Unknown to present day mainstream Philippine Education. Buried by the destructive sands of time and Sunken by the war waging seas of fate, lies a paradise of melting cultures, The Pearl of the Orient.

P.S. It's time for Fiilipino's to trace back history and use it! and give it a priority!!
 From the time of Negritos, to the arrival of Austronesians to the Ming dynasty to the Arab and Indian era to Spanish and American Colonization, and to the World War 2 and so on! 
Filipino culture and History is very beautiful you only need to realize it.

Update: this is not a Chinese propaganda, this video does not claim that China originally owns Philippines including spratlys. watch the whole thing!

[Also Watch old Manila heritage story: Warsaw,Poland(the most damaged city in the world) did replicated it's old beauty and build their heritage structure authentically, so why not Manila? every other city in Metro Manila should be modern with tall skyscrapers like BGC, they're just new cities anyway! but The City of Manila is very very old with a lots of stories to tell, the city should be where we see a glimpse of beautiful past.]

2186,CcUk4xy-Ai8,History of Jailbreaking,"basically, jailbreaking is a type of ‚Äúprivilege escalation.‚Äù Now that‚Äôs a pretty technical term so let me break it down. User privilege refers to how much access a user has to any given system, in this case iOS. And when you jailbreak your iPhone, you gain additional access to parts of the operating system that were previously restricted ‚Äì so you‚Äôre achieving an escalated level of privilege on your device, so privilege escalation. And this is usually achieved by exploiting some kind of design flaw or bug in the operating system. So to sum it up, jailbreaking is a way for users to do a lot more with their iPhone than what was previously possible.

The term ‚Äújailbreaking‚Äù originated with iOS, which began pretty much as soon as iPhones were released, but it‚Äôs been used to describe privilege escalation in other systems as well, like Playstation. Similar tools have been developed for other systems in recent years. For example, ‚Äúrooting‚Äù became a popular process among Android phone and tablet users to escalate privileges on those devices. Thanks to a huge community of hackers, developers, and coders that love to tinker with technology, there‚Äôs been a way to jailbreak pretty much every iteration of iOS within a short time of their release.",History

It turns out, Iran has a pretty long history of unrest in order to put power in the hands of the people, and the most recent revolution in 1979 was, at least at first, not necessarily about creating an Islamic state. It certainly turned out to be about that, but it was initially just about people who wanted to get rid of an oppressive regime. Listen up as John teaches you about Iran's long history of revolution.

They were called the Anunnaki, which means ‚ÄúThose Who from Heaven to Earth Came‚Äù.  These beings inhabited a distant orbiting planet called Nibiru, which only entered our solar system every 3,600 years.  They describe Nibiru as many times the diameter of Earth, and abundant with iron oxide, making its rivers and lakes appear red. A side note about Nibiru:  according to the Sumerian tablets, Nibiru‚Äôs atmosphere began to deteriorate and became a hostile place for life, and in order to restore it, the Annunaki needed one important element for their atmosphere:  gold.

In the 14th century a Muslim historian named Ibn Khaldun wrote about the pattern of history. Farmers would build irrigation systems supporting villages and towns. Later some warrior would bring these towns under his rule and form a united political entity, like a kingdom or an empire. Then a tribe of nomads would come along and conquer the kingdom, seize all the holdings and settle in their place and further expand the new empire. As time went by the nomads would assimilate and become soft city dwellers. Exactly the kind of people they had conquered and at this point another tribe of nomads would come along and conquer them and take their empire. Conquest, consolidation, expansion, degeneration and conquest, this was the pattern of history.

In which John Green teaches you about a time of relative tumult in the United States, the 1960s. America was changing rapidly in the 1960s, and rights movements were at the forefront of those changes. Civil Rights were dominant, but the 60s also saw growth in the Women's Movement, the LGBT rights movement, the Latino rights movement, and the American Indian movement. Also, Americans began to pay a bit more attention to the environment. All this change happened against the backdrop of the Cold War and the Rise of Conservatism. It was just wild. John will teach you about sit-ins, Freedom Rides, The March on Washington, MLK, JFK, LBJ, and NOW. Man, that is a lot of initialisms. And one acronym.

The Onin War tore Japan apart, but also kicked off the Sengoku Jidai or Warring States Period that's a seminal part of Japanese history. The power of the shogun dissolved and regional clan leaders or daimyo fought for control of the country. In the mid 16th century, near Kyoto, a clan called the Matsudaira found itself pinched between two great rivals: the Oda and the Imagawa. Abducted as a hostage by the Oda, the scion of the Matsudaira clan (the young Tokugawa Ieyasu) grew up to fight alongside of the Imagawa when he was released. Their combined forces threatened to destroy the entire Oda clan, but Oda Nobunaga had a different idea. They clashed at the Battle of Okehazama.

Can you hear my heartbeat?
Tired of feeling never enough
I close my eyes and tell myself that my dreams will come true

There'll be no more darkness
when you believe in yourself you are unstoppable

We were born to make history
We'll make it happen, we'll turn it around
Yes, we were born to make history

Bob Dylan going electric. Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock. The Beatles on Ed Sullivan. Michael Jackson‚Äôs Moonwalk. Queen at Live Aid. Elvis Presley singing Hound Dog and gyrating his hips. Beethoven debuting his 9th Symphony. Nirvana on MTV Unplugged. All of these are influential moments in music history. Without moments like the Sugarhill Gang reaching the Top 40, we never would have had rappers like Kendrick Lamar or the Notorious B.I.G. Without Madonna performing Like a Virgin on the MTV Awards, we never would have had Britney Spears singing Baby One More Time. Music legends like Johnny Cash, The Who, Freddie Mercury and more mad moments that shaped music history, and changed modern music forever.

2219,6E9WU9TGr,"The Black Legend, Native Americans, and Spaniards: Crash Course US History #1","In which John Green kicks off Crash Course US History! Why, you may ask, are we covering US History, and not more World History, or the history of some other country, or the very specific history of your home region? Well, the reasons are many. But, like it or not, the United States has probably meddled in your country to some degree in the last 236 years or so, and that means US History is relevant all over the world. In episode 1, John talks about the Native Americans who lived in what is now the US prior to European contact. This is a history class, not archaeology, so we're mainly going to cover written history. That means we start with the first sustained European settlement in North America, and that means the Spanish. The Spanish have a long history with the natives of the Americas, and not all of it was positive. The Spanish were definitely not peaceful colonizers, but what colonizers are peaceful? Colonization pretty much always results in an antagonistic relationship with the locals. John teaches you about early Spanish explorers, settlements, and what happened when they didn't get along with the indigenous people. The story of their rocky relations has been called the Black Legend. Which is not a positive legend.

""Never give a ‚ÄúSpeech‚Äù, says Richard Greene. In this masterful talk, he explains how the great speakers in history use 7 secrets and how we can all become a great speaker by following these secrets and by not just giving a ""speech"" but rather creating ""conversations"" from the heart.

Richard has dedicated himself to creating new paradigms in Public Speaking, Politics, and even our understanding of God

Called ""The Master of Charisma"" by The Sunday Times, Richard quit his law practice to coach Presidents, Prime Ministers, Senators, Governors, CEOs, Royalty and celebrities in 44 countries. Chief Judge on TLC's ""The Messengers"", Author, ""Words That Shook The World: 100 Years of Unforgettable Speeches and Events"".

Richard Studied Political Science in The US and UK, ran for Congress in 1992, advises countless political leaders, hosted ""Hollywood CLOUT"", a live ""Hollywood Meets Politics"" talk show on Air America Radio for 3 years, blogs for The Huffington Post, created the non-partisan, celebrity driven ""Choose YOUR America"" campaign and ""The 2014 Midterm Election 'Answer-Thon'"" to increase political engagement in America.


About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",History

Doch w√§hrend die einen Seite an Seite f√ºr ihre Ziele k√§mpfen, stolpern die anderen √ºber Eifers√ºchteleien oder ihre Streitsucht, werden zu erbitterten Feinden.

Dass ein Streit unter Geschwistern sogar lebensgef√§hrlich sein kann, haben die Tudor-Schwestern Elisabeth und Mary eindrucksvoll unter Beweis gestellt. Die katholische und ""blutige Mary"" lie√ü nicht nur jede Menge Protestanten hinrichten, sondern verfolgte auch ihre verhasste Halbschwester Elisabeth, den ""Bastard"" von K√∂nig Heinrich VIII. und Anne Boleyn. Elisabeth landete im Tower und konnte nur mit einem Trick dem Schafott entkommen. Wenige Jahre sp√§ter, nach dem fr√ºhen Tod Marys I. von England, bestieg sie selbst den Thron und regierte England lange und erfolgreich. 

Reinhold Messner hingegen verliert seinen j√ºngeren Bruder durch ein tragisches Ungl√ºck. Von einer gemeinsamen Expedition im Himalaya kommt nur einer der Extrembergsteiger lebend zur√ºck. Die genauen Umst√§nde des Todes von G√ºnther Messner sind bis heute nicht gekl√§rt. 

John F. und Robert, die ber√ºhmtesten Br√ºder des Kennedy-Clans, teilen nicht nur die Leidenschaft f√ºr die Politik, sondern auch ihr tragisches Schicksal: Beide sterben bei einem Mordanschlag.

They describe Nibiru as many times the diameter of Earth, and abundant with iron oxide, making its rivers and lakes appear red. A side note about Nibiru:  according to the Sumerian tablets, Nibiru‚Äôs atmosphere began to deteriorate and became a hostile place for life, and in order to restore it, the Annunaki needed one important element for their atmosphere:  gold.

In which John Green teaches you about capitalism and socialism in a way that is sure to please commenters from both sides of the debate. Learn how capitalism arose from the industrial revolution, and then gave rise to socialism. Learn about how we got from the British East India Company to iPhones and consumer culture in just a couple of hundred years. Stops along the way include the rise of industrial capitalism, mass production, disgruntled workers, Karl Marx, and the Socialist Beard. The socialist reactions to the ills of capitalism are covered as well, and John discusses some of the ideas of Karl Marx, and how they've been implemented or ignored in various socialist states. Plus, there are robots!

2248,5SnR-e0S6I,Globalization I - The Upside: Crash Course World History #41,"In which John Green teaches you about globalization, a subject so epic, so, um, global, it requires two videos. In this video, John follows the surprisingly complex path of t-shirt as it criss-crosses the world before coming to rest on your doorstep, and eventually in your dresser. (Unless you're one of those people who never puts their laundry away and lives out of a laundry basket. If that's the case, shame on you.) Anyway, the story of the t-shirt and its manufacture in far-flung places like China, Guatemala, and India is a microcosm of what's going on in the global economy. Globalization is a bit of a mixed bag, and there have definitely been winners and losers along the way. In this episode John will talk about some of the benefits that have come along with it. Next week, he'll get into some of the less-positive side effects of globalization.

Also, you should turn on the captions.

In which John Green wraps up revolutions month with what is arguably the most revolutionary of modern revolutions, the Industrial Revolution. While very few leaders were beheaded in the course of this one, it changed the lives of more people more dramatically than any of the political revolutions we've discussed. So, why did the Industrial Revolution happen around 1750 in the United Kingdom? Coal. Easily accessible coal, it turns out. All this, plus you'll finally learn the difference between James Watt and Thomas Newcomen, and will never again be caught telling people that your blender has a 900 Newcomen motor.

2254,1-JAx3nU,A Brief History of Pi,"Get 10% off Squarespace by following this link: http://squarespace.com/simonclark

Check out my new website here! 

Note that there's a huge amount about pi that I didn't cover in this video due to time - I didn't even mention proofs of it being irrational and transcendental, or why we call it pi! I chose to focus on the development of its approximation as a hook to teach the broader history of mathematics, rather than make this video an exhaustive list of facts. The wiki is a great place to learn more about the rest of the number's history and applications in maths and physics:  

A few nitpicky things:
- I made mistakes distinguishing between 'digits of pi calculated' and 'decimal points of pi calculated' in some sections, so it is possible that this error is elsewhere without me knowing.
- Archimedes didn't do his approximation with squares, he started with hexagons and then increased the order of the polygon. I chose to present the zeroth order version of his algorithm using squares for simplicity, but note that this is not what he did.
- Something which got lost from the final version of this video is my argument that during the Age of Enlightenment pi shifted from being a physical (measured) constant to a purely logical (theoretical) one. This then embodies the philosophical shift in society at the time. This is hinted at but not fully explained, so I thought I'd put this here.
- Lastly, I am truly sorry for the pronunciations which I doubtlessly completely murdered in this video. At least I spared you my attempt at Chinese.

I am hugely indebted to Alex Bellos and his excellent book Alex's Adventures in Numberland for the inspiration to make this video. There is an entire chapter of the book devoted to a broader but shallower discussion of pi and its history, which I highly recommend.

View full lesson: 

2,500 years ago, the writing of history as we know it didn‚Äôt exist. The past was recorded as a list of events, with little explanation for their causes beyond accepting things as the will of the gods. Herodotus wanted a deeper understanding, so he took a new approach: looking at events from both sides to understand the reasons for them. Mark Robinson explains how ‚Äúhistory‚Äù came into being.

In which John Green teaches you about the early days of the Civil Rights movement. By way of providing context for this, John also talks a bit about wider America in the 1950s. The 1950s are a deeply nostalgic period for many Americans, but there is more than a little idealizing going on here. The 1950s were a time of economic expansion, new technologies, and a growing middle class. America was becoming a suburban nation thanks to cookie-cutter housing developments like the Levittowns.  While the white working class saw their wages and status improve, the proverbial rising tide wasn't lifting all proverbial ships. A lot of people were excluded from the prosperity of the 1950s. Segregation in housing and education made for some serious inequality for African Americans. As a result, the Civil Rights movement was born. John will talk about the early careers of Martin Luther King, Thurgood Marshall, Rosa Parks, and even Earl Warren. He'll teach you about Brown v Board of Education, and the lesser known Mendez vs Westminster, the Montgomery Bus Boycott, and all kinds of other stuff.

While Europe was indeed having some issues, many other parts of the world were thriving and relatively enlightened. John covers European Feudalism, the cultural blossoming of the Islamic world, and the scientific and artistic advances in China, all during these ""Dark Ages."" Along the way, John will raise questions about the validity of Europe's status as a continent, reveal the best and worst years of his life, and frankly state that science and religion were once able to coexist.

Speed, quickness, acceleration‚Ä¶ the fastest, most electrifying players in the NFL. The guys with ‚ÄúGET AWAY FROM THE COPS SPEED‚Äù. These are the players with the type of supersonic speed few athletes have achieved over history. These are not just the players that destroy the combine, and post up the fastest 40 yard dash times, but instead these players are measured on pure burnability when stepping on the field. These are the players that could have made a living running track instead of football‚Ä¶ the players that can return the ball for a touchdown to win a game after fumbling it with no time remaining, the players that coaches lose sleep over figuring out ways to stop.

Lyrics


I got drunk and fell asleep atop the sheets but luckily i left the heater on.
And in my dreams i wrote the best song that i've ever written...can't remember how it goes.
I stayed drunk and fell awake and i was cycling on a plane and far away i heard you say you liked me.
We drifted to a party -- cool. The people went to arty school. They made their paints by mixing acid wash and lemonade

In my brain I re-arrange the letters on the page to spell your name

I found an ezra pound and made a bet that if i found a cigarette i'd drop it all and marry you.
Just then a song comes on: ""you can't always get what you want"" -- the rolling stones, oh woe is we, the irony!
The stones became the moss and once all inhibitions lost, the hipsters made a mission to the farm.
We drove by tractor there, the yellow straw replaced our hair, we laced the dairy river with the cream of sweet vermouth.

In my brain I re-arrange the letters on the page to spell your name

You said ""we only live once"" so we touched a little tongue, and instantly i wanted to...
I lost my train of thought and jumped aboard the Epping as the doors were slowly closing on the world.
I touched on and off and rubbed my arm up against yours and still the inspector inspected me.
The lady in the roof was living proof that nothing really ever is exactly as it seems.

In my brain I re-arrange the letters on the page to spell your name

We caught the river boat downstream and ended up beside a team of angry footballers.
I fed the ducks some krill then we were sucked against our will into the welcome doors of the casino.
We drank green margaritas, danced with sweet senoritas, and we all went home as winners of a kind.
You said ""i guarantee we'll have more fun, drink till the moon becomes the sun, and in the taxi home i'll sing you a triffids song!""

In my brain I re-arrange the letters on the page to spell your name",History

A main part of my ministry is to educate so that lies can be truly seen and bondage be broken.  Many people are against Christianity for many reasons, but one of the biggest reasons is they don't understand the history behind it.  So my next series of videos will be educating my viewers on the history of religion. In an effort to keep the time down, it's just a summary so if there is something left out or that you don't understand leave it in the comments and I will try to answer if I can.  I hope this blesses whoever watched.  The Lord says his people suffer for a lack of knowledge and my goal is to try and stop the suffering.

Take a moment and think about it. Remember it, Share it and maybe, just maybe, we can be great again!

The point of this video? Not to create animosity nor give an audience to hateful statements from people who, because of their own apathy, in part created the world we now live. The point of this video is to make anyone who cares to pull together and stop the down fall as best as they can. To be good to one another and stop blaming everybody else for our own short comings. To heal ourselves so that we can heal others. Not as separate parts, but as a whole sum of Humanity!

This video has now been seen in 190+ countries!
Still people don't seem to be getting the point.
I am a human being just as you. Doing things for the right reasons just as you.
If you're not treating your fellow man (Mankind) (Human Beings) with compassion, or at least treating them as you would be treated, then how are you helping the situation.
And if you're not helping the situation, then what are you doing?
Its not about invisible lines that divide us rather human qualities that unit us.

It's a lie to think your not good enough. There are two entities in the world.
1. Evil This is where one feels Anger, Jealousy, Greed, Resentment, Lies, and Inferiority.
2. Goodness This is where one feels Joy, Peace, Love, Hope, Humility, Kindness, Empathy and Truth.
As I read over the comments I see both Evil and Goodness shared. It is not a country that is evil or good. Rather it is a personal choice of the people in any country to be either Good or Evil. And they do so through their actions.",History

What I have come to now is a desire to start to create my own original content.    How quickly this will go depends on the support I get for the work.   

At first I am going to be experimenting with software and equipment to see what is possible.   The idea is to eventually be producing interesting documentaries of BC History.

The Khajuraho Group of Monuments is a group of Hindu and Jain temples in Madhya Pradesh, India, about 175 kilometres (109 mi) southeast of Jhansi. They are one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India.[The temples are famous for their nagara-style architectural symbolism and their erotic sculptures.

Most Khajuraho temples were built between 950 and 1050 by the Chandela dynasty. Historical records note that the Khajuraho temple site had 85 temples by the 12th century, spread over 20 square kilometers. Of these, only about 25 temples have survived, spread over 6 square kilometers.Of the various surviving temples, the Kandariya Mahadeva Temple is decorated with a profusion of sculptures with intricate details, symbolism and expressiveness of ancient Indian art

The Khajuraho group of temples were built together but were dedicated to two religions, Hinduism and Jainism, suggesting a tradition of acceptance and respect for diverse religious views among Hindus and Jains in the region

Mon c≈ìur s'ouvre √† ta voix,
comme s'ouvrent les fleurs
aux baisers de l'aurore!
Mais, √¥ mon bienaim√©,
pour mieux s√©cher mes pleurs,
que ta voix parle encore!
Dis-moi qu'√† Dalila
tu reviens pour jamais.
Redis √† ma tendresse
les serments d'autrefois,
ces serments que j'aimais!
|: Ah! r√©ponds, r√©ponds √† ma tendresse!
Verse-moi, verse-moi l'ivresse! :|

Ainsi qu'on voit des bl√©s
les √©pis onduler
sous la brise l√©g√®re,
ainsi fr√©mit mon coeur,
pr√™t √† se consoler,
√† ta voix qui m'est ch√®re!
La fl√®che est moins rapide
√† porter le tr√©pas,
que ne l'est ton amante
√† voler dans tes bras!
|: Ah! r√©ponds √† ma tendresse!
Verse-moi, verse-moi l'ivresse! :|
Samson! Samson! Je t'aime!



""De' Miei Bollenti Spiriti"" (Giuseppe Verdi)
Lunge da lei per me non v'ha diletto!
Volaron gi√† tre lune
Dacch√© la mia Violetta
Agi per me lasci√≤, dovizie, amori
E le pompose feste,
Ove, agli omaggi avvezza,
Vedea schiavo ciascun di sua bellezza.
Ed or contenta in questi ameni luoghi
Tutto scorda per me.
Qui presso a lei io rinascer mi sento,
E dal soffio d'amor rigenerato
Scordo ne'gaudii suoi tutto il passato.

De' miei bollenti spiriti
Il giovanile ardore
Ella tempr√≤ col placido
Sorriso dell'amor, dell'amor!
Dal d√¨ che disse:
Vivere io voglio io voglio a te fedel,
Dell'universo immemore
Io vivo, io vivo quasi,
Io vivo quasi in ciel.

Dal d√¨ che disse:
Vivere io voglio a te fedel,
Ah s√¨‚Ä¶dell'universo immemore
Io vivo, io vivo quasi,
Io vivo quasi in ciel.
Io vivo in ciel.
Dell'universo immemore.
Io vivo quasi in ciel.
Ah s√¨, io vivo quasi in cielo. 
Io vivo quasi in ciel.



""Apri la Tua Finestra"" (Pietro Mascagni)
Apri la tua finestra!
Jor son io
Che vengo al tuo chiamar,
Povera Dhia!
Apri la tua finestra
Al raggio mio!
Apri il tuo cor
A mia calda mal√¨a!
Jor ha ascoltata, o Dhia,
La tua preghiera!
Apri l'anima tua,
Fanciulla, al Sole!
Apri l'anima tua alle mie parole!
Apri il tuo cuore a me,
Fanciulla, e spera!
Tu vuoi morir?
Morire io ti far√≤
Ma ti far√≤ morir dal Sol baciata,
Poscia al paese eterno ti trarr√≤...

Hunter Ewen is a dramatic music composer, educator, and multimedia designer. During the day, Dr. Ewen teaches strategies for digital creativity at the University of Colorado, the children‚Äôs collaborative art center Reel Kids, the City of Longmont, and as an independent educator. At night, he composes, solders, choreographs, and directs interdisciplinary projects around the world. Experimental performance practices and unusual notation figure prominently in Ewen‚Äôs works. A believer that compositions should be both seen and heard, his music looks as strange as it sounds. Swirles, squiggles, arrows, and fangs often replace traditional notes and rests. His aesthetic preferences gravitate towards yowls and yips and wails and squeals. Towards screams that masquerade as art. Towards clamor and deviance. Ewen‚Äôs music swings from chandeliers.

2354,daVaEoF5Hrk,Arnold Sch√∂nberg - Wassily Kandinsky: Music and Art Get One,"The early years of the 20th Century signed a terrific advance in the Physical Sciences. The Special (1905) and General (1916)  Theories of Relativity and the advent of Quantum Mechanics (1926) changed our lives profoundly. Around the same years, a similar revolution took place in both Music and Art. The year 1909 marks a decisive break with tonality (the structure of classical music) by Arnold Sch√∂nberg in his ""Three Piano Pieces"". The term 'Atonality' is commonly used to express this new type of composition. Wassily Kandinsky is credited with painting the first 'purely abstract' works. His production is vast and I could only include 20 of his works here, selected from a period of time that overlaps with the musical pieces by Sch√∂nberg presented in this video. They knew each other and have possibly influenced their works reciprocally. The video is an attempt to evince this intriguing 'connection' between music and painting.


About Arnold Sch√∂nberg (1874-1951):
...The final piece (of the Three Piano Pieces, Op.11) breaks through all constraints of traditional language or structure, cutting abruptly from extremes of eruptive power, as in the massively congested opening, to the most intense introspection. Perhaps Schoenberg had in mind Kandinsky, with whom he had close  contacts, when he likened such music to developments in painting -""without architecture... an ever-changing, unbroken succession of colours, rhythms and moods."" (From a Text by Peter Hill).

About Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944):
...As the ""Der Blaue Reiter""(*) Almanac essays and theorizing with composer Arnold Sch√∂nberg indicate, Kandinsky also expressed the communion between artist and viewer as being available to both the senses and the mind (Synesthesia). Hearing tones and chords as he painted, Kandinsky theorized that, for instance, yellow is the colour of middle C on a brassy trumpet; black is the colour of closure, and the end of things; and that combinations of colours produce vibrational frequencies, akin to chords played on a piano. Kandinsky also developed a theory of geometric figures and their relationships, claiming, for example, that the circle is the most peaceful shape and represents the human soul.  (From Wikipedia).

Note Added: (*) Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider) was a group of artists from the Neue √ºnstlervereinigung M√ºnchen in Munich, Germany. The group was founded by a number of Russian emigrants, including Wassily Kandinsky, Alexej von Jawlensky, Marianne von Werefkin, and native German artists, such as Franz Marc, August Macke and Gabriele M√ºnter. Der Blaue Reiter was a movement lasting from 1911 to 1914, fundamental to Expressionism, along with Die Br√ºcke which was founded in 1905.

Songs From the Northern Territory 4: Aboriginal Music From North-Eastern Arnhem Land Including Groote Eylandt 
Artist/Collector: 
Alice Moyle 
Label Information: 
Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS): AIAS 4 CD 
Media Type: 
CD 
Year: 
Recorded 1963; Released 1997 
Availability: 
AIATSIS 

Notes: For the purpose of music description, Eastern Arnhem Land of the Northern 
Territory is divided here as follows: the north-eastern sector including offshore 
islands; the eastern sector, extending along the coast as far south as the Roper 
River; and the Groote Eylandt archipelago north-west of the Gulf of Carpentaria. 
Field recordings reproduced on this compact disc were collected at Milingimbi and 
Yirrkala in the north-eastern sector and at Angurugu and Umbakumba on Groote Eylandt.
 
The Aboriginal communities at Milingimbi and Yirrkala, together with the people at 
Galiwin'ku (previously known as Elcho Island) have been referred to in the 
anthropological literature as the Murngin (WL Warner) and Wulamba (RM Berndt). More 
recently, they have become known as the Yolngu, from a local word meaning 'people'. 
The people on Groote Eylandt were known by mainland groups as the Wayingurra and 
their language, Ingurra. In the absence of a name for the Groote Eylandters, 
Warnindilyakwa, a name formerly given to one of the larger clans on the island, is 
sometimes used. Anindilyakwa is the name of the island language. 
Item characteristics of Eastern Arnhem Land clan songs performed and recorded in 
the 1960s-all of which were sung by men-are summarised here as follows: (1) a didjeridu 
accompaniment which utilises two tones differing widely in pitch (the interval between 
the higher or overblown tone and the fundamental often sounding close to a tenth 
but varying according to the shape and length of the hollowed branch); (2) a narrow 
vocal range of pitch (compare them, for instance, with Western Arnhem Land songs) 
which rarely exceeds a fifth or sixth and may be less than a second; (3) song words 
which are translatable, meaningful and appropriate to relevant clan territories 
and related myths; and (4) the occurrence of an unaccompanied vocal termination (UVT), 
or termination of a song item by voice or voices alone after the accompanying 
instruments have ceased. Good examples of this fourth item characteristic are to be 
heard on this disc (Track 1) and disc 3 (Track 11). 
Song refrains may consist of repeated strings of words and syllables, a prolonged 
single syllable or a repeated pattern of vocal sounds (for example, bird calls). 
These calls are incorporated into the particular sectional or phraselike structure 
of many item sequences performed in Eastern Arnhem Land. 
On Groote Eylandt (tracks 7-13), only the first three of the above characteristics 
are to be heard. There is no occurrence of the UVT in these items but the following 
additional characteristics distinguish emeba (Groote Eylandt clan songs) from manikay 
(north-eastern Arnhem Land clan songs): 
a. the shaky voice, a deliberate manner of vocal ornamentation used by some emeba singers; 
b. the break or brief cessation of the vocal part of a Groote Eylandt clan song which is 
signalled by certain words the singer chooses to sing (the song subject at this point may 
fall, swoop down, or change abruptly in some way-it was said that the break gives the singer 
time to decide which words to sing next); 
c. a short, patterned interplay between sticks and didjeridu during the break; and 
d. the general clatter of stick-beating percussion arising from several different sources 
at the same time. 
Further comparison of emeba and manikay reveals that, whereas the durations of the latter 
are usually about one minute or less, emeba items may last for more than two minutes each.

Free Press Houston and Work-Order are proud to announce the lineup for Day For Night, an experiential arts and music festival featuring digital artists and renowned musical acts on December 19 and 20 in Houston, TX. Our 2015 lineup represents the culmination of years of development.

Musical artists featured: Kendrick Lamar, New Order, Philip Glass Ensemble, Dillon Francis, Janelle Mon√°e, Flying Lotus, Death Grips, Madeon, Nicolas Jaar, Psychic TV, CocoRosie, Elliphant, Battles, Dan Deacon, Com Truise, Cazwell, Amanda Lepore, Holly Herndon, Julien Bayle, Indian Jewelry, U.S. Girls, Jont√© Moaning, Prince Rama, DERU, Matt Thibideau, Roman Gianarthur, Richard Ramirez, Christine Renee, Future Blondes, BOAN, Millennial Grave, Wrestlers, Children of Pop, B L A C K I E, Hearts of Animals, Josiah Gabriel, FLCON FCKER, The Vanity, Light Wheel,Jerk, Bart Black, Prismo, and DJ Fredster. 

This immersive experience showcases leading visual artists who will be employing varying mediums such as light, projection, LED, and sound. The visual lineup includes Casey Reas, Zach Lieberman, School for Poetic Computation, Refik Anadol, Markus Heckmann, Mark Eats, Kamil Nawratil, Nanotak, Gabriel Pulecio, Vincent Houze + AV&C, Masomenos, David Cihelna & Gene Han, Mathew Dryhurst, Alex Czetwertynski, Work-Order, Night Moves, and Neil Ebbflo. 


Day For Night is currently the only confirmed U.S. date for New Order.

Passes to the two day art and music festival will be available at 10AM on Thursday, October 8, via www.dayfornight.io. Two ticket levels will be made available. General Admission will give access to the art installations as well as all musical performances on three stages for the entire weekend at a price of $185. VIP tickets are limited and will include front of stage pit access with private bar, complimentary beverages and small plates, access to private lounge, rapid entry, and commemorative lanyard for $750. Thousands of blind pre-sale tickets sold out in less than 24 hours when the event was announced in early September. 

Curator Alex Czetwertynski explains, ‚ÄúThe festival's title, ‚ÄúDay For Night,‚Äù provides the main key to understand the work being presented, as that space between day/night or light/dark is where our perception gets the blurriest. All of the artists in our roster will, in one way or another, transform our feeling of time, space, perspective, and place. They were chosen because of their common use of computational media to manipulate light, time, and sound. Their approaches to light and sound can be literal, or purely as a medium to reveal content.  And with the large scale canvas that Day for Night is offering these artists, we can only expect this audio-visual exchange to be a heightened sensorial experience.‚Äù

With acres of immersive installations within the emerging field of digital art and performances by world-class musicians, each are curated not just for their musical talent but also the visual qualities of their stage presence, Day For Night seeks to redefine the festival experience and inspire attendees to re-examine the way they interact with and understand both art and music.",Art & Music

2374,jvYTiPQAyAE,How art and music create a new hybrid global culture: Rajae El Mouhandiz at TEDxBreda,"The ""one story"" of Muslims and immigrants we hear in the news and politics every day is ignoring the many stories of millions of women and men who do not see themselves in that old story, but as authors and owners of a new story where globalism and hybrid cultures are the stage and vehicle. They represent a new story of being and belonging in the world. A story where history is honoured as the sacrifices of those who came before us. Their parents moved to the west to start something new, mixed with the old, and individuals like Rajae El Mouhandiz are the product. As the new stories they are shaping do not yet have a language and a platform, one has to start telling the stories through art and music. And personal strength.

Regarding Rajae El Mouhandiz
Rajae El Mouhandiz is a Dutch-Moroccan-Algerian poet, singer, composer, producer, and founder of the record label Truthseeker Records. After leaving her family at age 15 and being the first Moroccan to study at a Dutch conservatory at age 16. El Mouhandiz left classical music at age 20 to follow her own artistic path, seeking to incorporate her cultural roots. She started her own record label at age 25, released two albums and is currently developing her third album in Morocco. On international women's day 2013 El Mouhandiz premiered her first short documentary film, about the acceptance of Muslim women in mainstream media and the music industry. Currently she is developing her second short film, focusing on her Maghreb heritage and the story of her grandfathers. She is also one of the 60 female curators of the groundbreaking international MUSLIMA exhibition, held in The USA, The Philipines, The U.A.E and Denmark. And together with the British Council Ireland and a Dutch theatre production company, El Mouhandiz is producing the Dutch and European version of the Hijabi Monologues; a theatre space for the experiences of Muslim women; a space to breathe as they are; a space that does not claim to tell every story and speak for every voice. The Dutch premiere is planned in September 2014. Rajae was nominated as Muslim Leader of tomorrow in 2005. She was nominated by Elsevier magazine as one of Hollands' 10 biggest talents in 2007, in the field of contemporary music and from 2009 -- 2012 she was the only female contemporary artist to be nominated on the list of the 500 most influential Muslims in the world. This year Rajae has been nominated for the 5th year in a row. More information: www.rajae.net",Art & Music

The impulse to create art and music comes from deep evolutionary drives, explains Bill Nye the Science Guy. In the animal kingdom, song and visual displays are great tools for, um, flirting.

Transcript: Michael Montoya: Hi Bill. Michael Montoya here. What do you think is the evolutionary advantage to humanity being both musically and artistically creative? And where do you think this initial spark of creativity came from?

Bill Nye: Michael. Michael. This is a great question and susceptible to speculation. Apparently music and art is part of the way we communicate and it's certainly the way you attract mates. I'll just put it to you that way. Musicians and artists engage other people in a way that people who don't use music and don't use art do not. Now, there's a lot of talk about songbirds in evolutionary biology and they all have these songs, which must be pleasing to the ears of their potential mates and also must send messages to others of their species, so I guess to other species as well. I am angry; this is my territory; I'm looking for a mate; it's a sunny day. These sort of announcements are made by other species so you figure humans have just taken it just a whole other level with albums and record release parties and art exhibits and art museums and art galleries. So it really is deep within us and I think art enriches our lives, engages our brains and stimulates us in a way that nothing else we do does. So, this is only speculation on my part but music especially certainly inspires us. That's for sure. So carry on Michael. Turn it up loud.",Art & Music

""DEATH SQUAD ANTHEM"" LYRICS

If the mob wants blood
Then they‚Äôll fucking get it
You started this war
Now you‚Äôll fucking regret it

21st Century Death Squad Anthem
Your life is on the line
Your obedience is their ransom
21st Century Death Squad Anthem
The methods of peace are obsolete
So grab your guns and sing with me

Impatient in our rage
Force fed this disillusion
Missing a torn-out page
Suppress the revolution
All eyes on the big stage
Swept to the institutions
Complacent in our cage
Ready for the execution

21st Century Death Squad Anthem
Your life is on the line
Your obedience is their ransom
21st Century Death Squad Anthem
The methods of peace are obsolete
So grab your guns and sing with me

If the mob wants blood
Then they‚Äôll fucking get it

Riot, resist
Tyrants cease to exist
Riot, resist
Tyrants cease to exist

Divide and conquer
While they conjure
Divisive means
For the stronger
Addicted by design
To a system in decline

Arise the scourge of man
Divide the foolish
Dilute the masses
Deprived of liberty
We‚Äôll not stand by while
Society collapses

Impatient in our rage
Force fed this disillusion
Missing a torn-out page
Suppress the revolution
All eyes on the big stage
Swept to the institutions
Complacent in our cage
Ready for the execution

21st Century Death Squad Anthem
Your life is on the line
Your obedience is their ransom
21st Century Death Squad Anthem
The methods of peace are obsolete
So grab your guns and sing with me",Art & Music

MP3 DOWNLOAD: https://www.brainwavehub.com/download...

Using a combination of Theta, Alpha and Beta frequencies, this audio is designed to act as an aid to your creative pursuits, encourage fluid, abstract thought processes while maintaining focus over long periods. 

The Theta / Beta frequencies range from 6-7hz & 13-15hz respectively, with 8-12hz alpha waves interspersed throughout. The patterns switch in the following manner, every 5 minutes: 

0-5 mins - Alpha / Beta; 
5-10 mins - Theta / Alpha; 
10 - 15 mins -Alpha / Beta; 
etc. etc.  up to one hour. 

This quick interplay between beta and theta/alpha promotes a balance between concrete thought and creative abstraction. This way we can encourage and bring to light new insights, generate new & original ideas, contemplate a concept from various points of view, and problem solve holistically. The beta phases serve to not only promote focus and concentration, but to also analyse, organise and therefore make sense of the abstractions derived from the more non linear holistic mind states induced by Theta and Alpha. 

In addition to using this audio during work or study, you can also use it in a rested state while meditating to assist with creative visualisation. 


As binaural beats have been integrated into this track, we recommend using headphones.

2408,d8VA7_qSC7U,With One Voice in Montreal: Art and Music Helping Homeless People.,"""Art to me is a humanitarian act and I believe that there is a responsibility that art should somehow be able to effect mankind, to make the world a better place.""  ~ Jeff Koons

Something I don't talk about very often is that at its very core Invisible People is art. Years ago, my boss at the time had in his office a coffee table book of photos of homeless people. The pictures humanized homeless men, woman, and families as the real people that they are. I said to myself: ""I could do this with video."" Shortly after, I was laid off and Invisible People was started. If you'd like to learn more about my story and how Invisible People started, please watch this documentary 

Art and music have the power to bring people together and change our world for the better. Both art and music can play a huge role in giving homeless people a purpose. Yes, housing ends homelessness but just putting homeless people in boxes will never end homelessness. People need to thrive and not just survive. Art therapy and music therapy are powerful tools for wellness, and as you'll see in this vlog - art, music, and theater can be used for advocacy to help change policy. 

Last year, With One Voice sent a delegation to the ATSA √âtat d'Urgence Festival in Montreal, Canada. It was an amazing few days meeting new friends and brainstorming on how we can help other creative organizations scale to have more impact helping homeless people. I shot a bunch of footage but never got around to editing it into something until this month. My dream is someday to be able to produce mini-documentaries like this vlog highlighting cool ideas and amazing people working to end homelessness who may not always get a lot of media attention.  

For example, in this vlog, I reference a video I shot when I was invited to the Dallas Public Library that you can watch here:  The folks behind With One Voice saw this video and invited Jo and Heather to Montreal to share about creating safe spaces. I hope to one day be able to produce more like this but on a much larger scale! 

In her interview, Beth Knowles from the City of Manchester and With One Voice references the North America Review of Arts and Homelessness that you can find here: 

From With One Voice's website: 

With One Voice began as a showcase event curated by Streetwise Opera at the 2012 Cultural Olympiad in London. For the first time in Olympic history, it gave a platform for homeless people ‚Äì celebrating the artistic achievements of 300 performers who had experienced homelessness.

To learn more about the people and the organizations in this video, here is a link to information about the delegates  For more information about With One Voice, please visit their website:

About Invisible People: 

Invisible People goes beyond the rhetoric, statistics, political debates, and limitations of social services to examine poverty in America via a medium that audiences of all ages can understand, and can‚Äôt ignore. The vlog puts into context one of our nation‚Äôs most troubling and prevalent issues through personal stories captured by the lens of Mark Horvath ‚Äì its founder ‚Äì and brings into focus the pain, hardship and hopelessness that millions face each day. One story at a time, videos posted on InvisiblePeople.tv shatter the stereotypes of America‚Äôs homeless, force shifts in perception and deliver a call to action that is being answered by national brands, nonprofit organizations and everyday citizens now committed to opening their eyes and their hearts to those too often forgotten.

Invisible People is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to changing the way we think about people experiencing homelessness.",Art & Music
2409,P0Rlw8mo8g,Is Music Art? ‚Äì Hangout on Air,"In our fifth and final 'Hangout on Air', Miranda Sawyer is joined by artist Haroon Mirza, music producer Will Skeaping, record sleeve designer Leif Podhajsky and Tate's Adrian Shaw for a lively discussion about music and art.

Miranda Sawyer is a journalist, writer and broadcaster covering a wide range of interests, including music, art, radio and theatre. She is currently a feature writer and radio critic for The Observer, and is a regular arts critic in print and on television and radio. Miranda is also on the board of Tate Members.

Haroon Mirza is a British artist who combines a variety of readymade and time based material to create audio compositions, which are often realised as site-specific installations. In doing so, Mirza complicates the distinctions between noise, sound and music, and alters the function and meaning of everyday objects and and socio-cultural constructs.

Adrian Shaw is part of Tate‚Äôs Learning department, working on the Young People‚Äôs Programme. He has been organising music events since the early 1990‚Äôs and introduced large scale music programming to Tate over 10 years ago.  Now established as ‚ÄòLate at Tate‚Äô, these events often explore the boundaries between music, performance and art.  Adrian is also a musician, and one half of the arts duo boyleANDshaw.

Will Skeaping is a creative consultant and music producer. Following a tour of duty at Google, he worked closely with rappers, authors and film makers as label manager at Lex Records, focusing on collaborations between artists and musicians. He is currently making an album uniting English folk music with vintage analogue synthesizers. 

Leif Podhajsky is an Australian artist and graphic designer, who‚Äôs distinctive bright, surreal abstractions have featured on posters and album covers for musicians including Mount Kimbie, Tame Impala, Grimes, Lykki Li and Foals. Leif says his work ‚Äúexplores themes of connectedness, the relevance of nature and the psychedelic or altered experience.‚Äù

2422,6eESW6-gE9M,TONY BENNETT IN THE STUDIO: A Life of Art and Music,"TONY BENNETT IN THE STUDIO: A Life of Art and Music
TONY BENNETT & R. SULLIVAN    Book Number: 74801    Product format: Hardback

With a career that spans 60 years and a fan base that spans all ages, Tony Bennett recently turned 80, and marked the milestone with a year-long creative outburst that included a chart-topping CD of duets with a diverse array of fellow superstar performers, from Streisand and Bono to Stevie Wonder and the Dixie Chicks. He starred in a sensational NBC TV special and performed in one sold-out show after another around the world. As if this were not enough, the UN named him 2007's Humanitarian Award honoree and the Smithsonian selected one of his paintings for their permanent collection. This lovely volume is a glorious celebration of Bennett's lifelong dedication to his passion for painting and singing. In a warm and revealing narrative, he and Robert Sullivan discuss the significant events of his life and career, his personal philosophy and the influences that continue to infuse his creative ability. He reflects on times he has shared with, and lessons he has learned from, the likes of Frank Sinatra, Pearl Bailey, Louis Armstrong, David Hockney and many, many more. Readers are whisked from his childhood, living above the grocery store where his father worked, to the magnificent apartment from where he now looks out over Central Park. Along the way he affords us a glimpse of his inner life. The book is richly illustrated with more than 200 reproductions - most of them previously unpublished - of his beautiful artwork, as well as a number of rare items from his collection. An endlessly entertaining 212 pages 29.5cm x 27cm very lavishly illustrated in colour and b/w with detailed appendix including a discography, art biography and an awards and honours listing as well as a FREE MUSIC CD of six tracks all performed by Tony Bennett.

2423,SDmdsuGr3KQ,Katawa Shoujo Beta - Shizune Act 3 (Full Art and Music),"Here is Shizune's Act 3. The official Steam forum dedicated to repairing the beta routes did not completely finish giving Shizune's route art and music direction, so I fixed it up myself. Knowing how to mod has never generated so many feels.

This is a playthrough of Shizune's Act 3 in the Beta of Katawa Shoujo. Act 1 was skipped due to it being exactly the same aside from the music and some grammar errors. Act 2 has been uploaded at  

I will upload Act 4 at some point in time, but I figured I should at least upload something pertaining to the beta route as of now instead of holding off everything.

I decided to keep the beta music in, but upon my insertion of art and music I put in some of the final version's music instead. The beta music just seems to fit the majority of the story in this route much better.

I came across a rather disturbing, yet slightly expected option in the beta that was either omitted or never finished. As it turns out, you could end up having sex with Misha at Shizune's house. During the scene where Misha confesses her love for Shizune, there was going to be a decision at some point in the conversation where you could choose to comfort her or refuse. If you do not comfort her, she tells you that she had a selfish thought that you would (this is shown at about  in the video) This effects multiple scenes, the most notable one being that Hisao and Misha agree to never tell Shizune about the affair. This in turn would not actually effect the story at all, but feelings of utter guilt would be inserted throughout many scenes. The most ridiculous part is that you could still get a good ending with Shizune, even after cheating on her, but I'll get into more detail about that once Act 4 comes along. For now, I will hold off the spoilers.

Katawa Shoujo is a bishoujo-style visual novel set in the fictional Yamaku High School for disabled children, located somewhere in modern Japan. Hisao Nakai, a normal boy living a normal life, has his life turned upside down when a congenital heart defect forces him to move to a new school after a long hospitalization. Despite his difficulties, Hisao is able to find friends‚Äîand perhaps love, if he plays his cards right. There are five main paths corresponding to the 5 main female characters, each path following the storyline pertaining to that character. This is the beta.",Art & Music

2432,OxI6uPQwu8I,Composer Chat 03 - Art and Music - Limitation as Freedom,"I am discussing the concept of limitation in the context of artistic freedom. When I am faced with the whiteness of my creative page, I like to set limiting parameters before I begin my work. Choosing to limit my creative output can bring focus and direction. The following are a few examples of the concept of limitation:

1. Georgia O'Keeffe uses soft and wavy curves in her paintings (example: Flower of Life II)

2. Claude Debussy focuses on the pentatonic and the octatonic scales in his compositions.

3. The game of chess limits the movements of the pieces both collectively and individually.

Lyrics of some songs:

""Mon couer s'ouvre √† ta voix""  (Camilie Saint-Saens)
Mon c≈ìur s'ouvre √† ta voix,
comme s'ouvrent les fleurs
aux baisers de l'aurore!
Mais, √¥ mon bienaim√©,
pour mieux s√©cher mes pleurs,
que ta voix parle encore!
Dis-moi qu'√† Dalila
tu reviens pour jamais.
Redis √† ma tendresse
les serments d'autrefois,
ces serments que j'aimais!
|: Ah! r√©ponds, r√©ponds √† ma tendresse!
Verse-moi, verse-moi l'ivresse! :|

Ainsi qu'on voit des bl√©s
les √©pis onduler
sous la brise l√©g√®re,
ainsi fr√©mit mon coeur,
pr√™t √† se consoler,
√† ta voix qui m'est ch√®re!
La fl√®che est moins rapide
√† porter le tr√©pas,
que ne l'est ton amante
√† voler dans tes bras!
|: Ah! r√©ponds √† ma tendresse!
Verse-moi, verse-moi l'ivresse! :|
Samson! Samson! Je t'aime!



""De' Miei Bollenti Spiriti"" (Giuseppe Verdi)
Lunge da lei per me non v'ha diletto!
Volaron gi√† tre lune
Dacch√© la mia Violetta
Agi per me lasci√≤, dovizie, amori
E le pompose feste,
Ove, agli omaggi avvezza,
Vedea schiavo ciascun di sua bellezza.
Ed or contenta in questi ameni luoghi
Tutto scorda per me.
Qui presso a lei io rinascer mi sento,
E dal soffio d'amor rigenerato
Scordo ne'gaudii suoi tutto il passato.

De' miei bollenti spiriti
Il giovanile ardore
Ella tempr√≤ col placido
Sorriso dell'amor, dell'amor!
Dal d√¨ che disse:
Vivere io voglio io voglio a te fedel,
Dell'universo immemore
Io vivo, io vivo quasi,
Io vivo quasi in ciel.

Dal d√¨ che disse:
Vivere io voglio a te fedel,
Ah s√¨‚Ä¶dell'universo immemore
Io vivo, io vivo quasi,
Io vivo quasi in ciel.
Io vivo in ciel.
Dell'universo immemore.
Io vivo quasi in ciel.
Ah s√¨, io vivo quasi in cielo. 
Io vivo quasi in ciel.



""Apri la Tua Finestra"" (Pietro Mascagni)
Apri la tua finestra!
Jor son io
Che vengo al tuo chiamar,
Povera Dhia!
Apri la tua finestra
Al raggio mio!
Apri il tuo cor
A mia calda mal√¨a!
Jor ha ascoltata, o Dhia,
La tua preghiera!
Apri l'anima tua,
Fanciulla, al Sole!
Apri l'anima tua alle mie parole!
Apri il tuo cuore a me,
Fanciulla, e spera!
Tu vuoi morir?
Morire io ti far√≤
Ma ti far√≤ morir dal Sol baciata,
Poscia al paese eterno ti trarr√≤...

Tu sarai amata!

Hunter Ewen is a dramatic music composer, educator, and multimedia designer. During the day, Dr. Ewen teaches strategies for digital creativity at the University of Colorado, the children‚Äôs collaborative art center Reel Kids, the City of Longmont, and as an independent educator. At night, he composes, solders, choreographs, and directs interdisciplinary projects around the world. Experimental performance practices and unusual notation figure prominently in Ewen‚Äôs works. A believer that compositions should be both seen and heard, his music looks as strange as it sounds. Swirles, squiggles, arrows, and fangs often replace traditional notes and rests. His aesthetic preferences gravitate towards yowls and yips and wails and squeals. Towards screams that masquerade as art. Towards clamor and deviance. Ewen‚Äôs music swings from chandeliers.

2466,daVaEoF5Hrk,Arnold Sch√∂nberg - Wassily Kandinsky: Music and Art Get One,"The early years of the 20th Century signed a terrific advance in the Physical Sciences. The Special (1905) and General (1916)  Theories of Relativity and the advent of Quantum Mechanics (1926) changed our lives profoundly. Around the same years, a similar revolution took place in both Music and Art. The year 1909 marks a decisive break with tonality (the structure of classical music) by Arnold Sch√∂nberg in his ""Three Piano Pieces"". The term 'Atonality' is commonly used to express this new type of composition. Wassily Kandinsky is credited with painting the first 'purely abstract' works. His production is vast and I could only include 20 of his works here, selected from a period of time that overlaps with the musical pieces by Sch√∂nberg presented in this video. They knew each other and have possibly influenced their works reciprocally. The video is an attempt to evince this intriguing 'connection' between music and painting.


About Arnold Sch√∂nberg (1874-1951):
...The final piece (of the Three Piano Pieces, Op.11) breaks through all constraints of traditional language or structure, cutting abruptly from extremes of eruptive power, as in the massively congested opening, to the most intense introspection. Perhaps Schoenberg had in mind Kandinsky, with whom he had close  contacts, when he likened such music to developments in painting -""without architecture... an ever-changing, unbroken succession of colours, rhythms and moods."" (From a Text by Peter Hill).

About Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944):
...As the ""Der Blaue Reiter""(*) Almanac essays and theorizing with composer Arnold Sch√∂nberg indicate, Kandinsky also expressed the communion between artist and viewer as being available to both the senses and the mind (Synesthesia). Hearing tones and chords as he painted, Kandinsky theorized that, for instance, yellow is the colour of middle C on a brassy trumpet; black is the colour of closure, and the end of things; and that combinations of colours produce vibrational frequencies, akin to chords played on a piano. Kandinsky also developed a theory of geometric figures and their relationships, claiming, for example, that the circle is the most peaceful shape and represents the human soul.  (From Wikipedia).

Note Added: (*) Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider) was a group of artists from the Neue √ºnstlervereinigung M√ºnchen in Munich, Germany. The group was founded by a number of Russian emigrants, including Wassily Kandinsky, Alexej von Jawlensky, Marianne von Werefkin, and native German artists, such as Franz Marc, August Macke and Gabriele M√ºnter. Der Blaue Reiter was a movement lasting from 1911 to 1914, fundamental to Expressionism, along with Die Br√ºcke which was founded in 1905.

Songs From the Northern Territory 4: Aboriginal Music From North-Eastern Arnhem Land Including Groote Eylandt 
Artist/Collector: 
Alice Moyle 
Label Information: 
Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS): AIAS 4 CD 
Media Type: 
CD 
Year: 
Recorded 1963; Released 1997 
Availability: 
AIATSIS 

Notes: For the purpose of music description, Eastern Arnhem Land of the Northern 
Territory is divided here as follows: the north-eastern sector including offshore 
islands; the eastern sector, extending along the coast as far south as the Roper 
River; and the Groote Eylandt archipelago north-west of the Gulf of Carpentaria. 
Field recordings reproduced on this compact disc were collected at Milingimbi and 
Yirrkala in the north-eastern sector and at Angurugu and Umbakumba on Groote Eylandt.
 
The Aboriginal communities at Milingimbi and Yirrkala, together with the people at 
Galiwin'ku (previously known as Elcho Island) have been referred to in the 
anthropological literature as the Murngin (WL Warner) and Wulamba (RM Berndt). More 
recently, they have become known as the Yolngu, from a local word meaning 'people'. 
The people on Groote Eylandt were known by mainland groups as the Wayingurra and 
their language, Ingurra. In the absence of a name for the Groote Eylandters, 
Warnindilyakwa, a name formerly given to one of the larger clans on the island, is 
sometimes used. Anindilyakwa is the name of the island language. 
Item characteristics of Eastern Arnhem Land clan songs performed and recorded in 
the 1960s-all of which were sung by men-are summarised here as follows: (1) a didjeridu 
accompaniment which utilises two tones differing widely in pitch (the interval between 
the higher or overblown tone and the fundamental often sounding close to a tenth 
but varying according to the shape and length of the hollowed branch); (2) a narrow 
vocal range of pitch (compare them, for instance, with Western Arnhem Land songs) 
which rarely exceeds a fifth or sixth and may be less than a second; (3) song words 
which are translatable, meaningful and appropriate to relevant clan territories 
and related myths; and (4) the occurrence of an unaccompanied vocal termination (UVT), 
or termination of a song item by voice or voices alone after the accompanying 
instruments have ceased. Good examples of this fourth item characteristic are to be 
heard on this disc (Track 1) and disc 3 (Track 11). 
Song refrains may consist of repeated strings of words and syllables, a prolonged 
single syllable or a repeated pattern of vocal sounds (for example, bird calls). 
These calls are incorporated into the particular sectional or phraselike structure 
of many item sequences performed in Eastern Arnhem Land. 
On Groote Eylandt (tracks 7-13), only the first three of the above characteristics 
are to be heard. There is no occurrence of the UVT in these items but the following 
additional characteristics distinguish emeba (Groote Eylandt clan songs) from manikay 
(north-eastern Arnhem Land clan songs): 
a. the shaky voice, a deliberate manner of vocal ornamentation used by some emeba singers; 
b. the break or brief cessation of the vocal part of a Groote Eylandt clan song which is 
signalled by certain words the singer chooses to sing (the song subject at this point may 
fall, swoop down, or change abruptly in some way-it was said that the break gives the singer 
time to decide which words to sing next); 
c. a short, patterned interplay between sticks and didjeridu during the break; and 
d. the general clatter of stick-beating percussion arising from several different sources 
at the same time. 
Further comparison of emeba and manikay reveals that, whereas the durations of the latter 
are usually about one minute or less, emeba items may last for more than two minutes each.

Free Press Houston and Work-Order are proud to announce the lineup for Day For Night, an experiential arts and music festival featuring digital artists and renowned musical acts on December 19 and 20 in Houston, TX. Our 2015 lineup represents the culmination of years of development.

Musical artists featured: Kendrick Lamar, New Order, Philip Glass Ensemble, Dillon Francis, Janelle Mon√°e, Flying Lotus, Death Grips, Madeon, Nicolas Jaar, Psychic TV, CocoRosie, Elliphant, Battles, Dan Deacon, Com Truise, Cazwell, Amanda Lepore, Holly Herndon, Julien Bayle, Indian Jewelry, U.S. Girls, Jont√© Moaning, Prince Rama, DERU, Matt Thibideau, Roman Gianarthur, Richard Ramirez, Christine Renee, Future Blondes, BOAN, Millennial Grave, Wrestlers, Children of Pop, B L A C K I E, Hearts of Animals, Josiah Gabriel, FLCON FCKER, The Vanity, Light Wheel,Jerk, Bart Black, Prismo, and DJ Fredster. 

This immersive experience showcases leading visual artists who will be employing varying mediums such as light, projection, LED, and sound. The visual lineup includes Casey Reas, Zach Lieberman, School for Poetic Computation, Refik Anadol, Markus Heckmann, Mark Eats, Kamil Nawratil, Nanotak, Gabriel Pulecio, Vincent Houze + AV&C, Masomenos, David Cihelna & Gene Han, Mathew Dryhurst, Alex Czetwertynski, Work-Order, Night Moves, and Neil Ebbflo. 


Day For Night is currently the only confirmed U.S. date for New Order.

Passes to the two day art and music festival will be available at 10AM on Thursday, October 8, via www.dayfornight.io. Two ticket levels will be made available. General Admission will give access to the art installations as well as all musical performances on three stages for the entire weekend at a price of $185. VIP tickets are limited and will include front of stage pit access with private bar, complimentary beverages and small plates, access to private lounge, rapid entry, and commemorative lanyard for $750. Thousands of blind pre-sale tickets sold out in less than 24 hours when the event was announced in early September. 

Curator Alex Czetwertynski explains, ‚ÄúThe festival's title, ‚ÄúDay For Night,‚Äù provides the main key to understand the work being presented, as that space between day/night or light/dark is where our perception gets the blurriest. All of the artists in our roster will, in one way or another, transform our feeling of time, space, perspective, and place. They were chosen because of their common use of computational media to manipulate light, time, and sound. Their approaches to light and sound can be literal, or purely as a medium to reveal content.  And with the large scale canvas that Day for Night is offering these artists, we can only expect this audio-visual exchange to be a heightened sensorial experience.‚Äù

With acres of immersive installations within the emerging field of digital art and performances by world-class musicians, each are curated not just for their musical talent but also the visual qualities of their stage presence, Day For Night seeks to redefine the festival experience and inspire attendees to re-examine the way they interact with and understand both art and music.",Art & Music

2486,jvYTiPQAyAE,How art and music create a new hybrid global culture: Rajae El Mouhandiz at TEDxBreda,"The ""one story"" of Muslims and immigrants we hear in the news and politics every day is ignoring the many stories of millions of women and men who do not see themselves in that old story, but as authors and owners of a new story where globalism and hybrid cultures are the stage and vehicle. They represent a new story of being and belonging in the world. A story where history is honoured as the sacrifices of those who came before us. Their parents moved to the west to start something new, mixed with the old, and individuals like Rajae El Mouhandiz are the product. As the new stories they are shaping do not yet have a language and a platform, one has to start telling the stories through art and music. And personal strength.

Regarding Rajae El Mouhandiz
Rajae El Mouhandiz is a Dutch-Moroccan-Algerian poet, singer, composer, producer, and founder of the record label Truthseeker Records. After leaving her family at age 15 and being the first Moroccan to study at a Dutch conservatory at age 16. El Mouhandiz left classical music at age 20 to follow her own artistic path, seeking to incorporate her cultural roots. She started her own record label at age 25, released two albums and is currently developing her third album in Morocco. On international women's day 2013 El Mouhandiz premiered her first short documentary film, about the acceptance of Muslim women in mainstream media and the music industry. Currently she is developing her second short film, focusing on her Maghreb heritage and the story of her grandfathers. She is also one of the 60 female curators of the groundbreaking international MUSLIMA exhibition, held in The USA, The Philipines, The U.A.E and Denmark. And together with the British Council Ireland and a Dutch theatre production company, El Mouhandiz is producing the Dutch and European version of the Hijabi Monologues; a theatre space for the experiences of Muslim women; a space to breathe as they are; a space that does not claim to tell every story and speak for every voice. The Dutch premiere is planned in September 2014. Rajae was nominated as Muslim Leader of tomorrow in 2005. She was nominated by Elsevier magazine as one of Hollands' 10 biggest talents in 2007, in the field of contemporary music and from 2009 -- 2012 she was the only female contemporary artist to be nominated on the list of the 500 most influential Muslims in the world. This year Rajae has been nominated for the 5th year in a row. More information: www.rajae.net",Art & Music

The impulse to create art and music comes from deep evolutionary drives, explains Bill Nye the Science Guy. In the animal kingdom, song and visual displays are great tools for, um, flirting.

Transcript: Michael Montoya: Hi Bill. Michael Montoya here. What do you think is the evolutionary advantage to humanity being both musically and artistically creative? And where do you think this initial spark of creativity came from?

Bill Nye: Michael. Michael. This is a great question and susceptible to speculation. Apparently music and art is part of the way we communicate and it's certainly the way you attract mates. I'll just put it to you that way. Musicians and artists engage other people in a way that people who don't use music and don't use art do not. Now, there's a lot of talk about songbirds in evolutionary biology and they all have these songs, which must be pleasing to the ears of their potential mates and also must send messages to others of their species, so I guess to other species as well. I am angry; this is my territory; I'm looking for a mate; it's a sunny day. These sort of announcements are made by other species so you figure humans have just taken it just a whole other level with albums and record release parties and art exhibits and art museums and art galleries. So it really is deep within us and I think art enriches our lives, engages our brains and stimulates us in a way that nothing else we do does. So, this is only speculation on my part but music especially certainly inspires us. That's for sure. So carry on Michael. Turn it up loud.",Art & Music

21st Century Death Squad Anthem
Your life is on the line
Your obedience is their ransom
21st Century Death Squad Anthem
The methods of peace are obsolete
So grab your guns and sing with me

All eyes on the big stage
Swept to the institutions
Complacent in our cage
Ready for the execution

If the mob wants blood

Riot, resist
Tyrants cease to exist
Riot, resist
Tyrants cease to exist

Divide and conquer
While they conjure
Divisive means
For the stronger
Addicted by design
To a system in decline

Arise the scourge of man
Divide the foolish
Dilute the masses
Deprived of liberty
We‚Äôll not stand by while
Society collapses

Impatient in our rage
Force fed this disillusion
Missing a torn-out page
Suppress the revolution
All eyes on the big stage
Swept to the institutions
Complacent in our cage
Ready for the execution

MP3 DOWNLOAD: https://www.brainwavehub.com/download...

Using a combination of Theta, Alpha and Beta frequencies, this audio is designed to act as an aid to your creative pursuits, encourage fluid, abstract thought processes while maintaining focus over long periods. 

The Theta / Beta frequencies range from 6-7hz & 13-15hz respectively, with 8-12hz alpha waves interspersed throughout. The patterns switch in the following manner, every 5 minutes: 

0-5 mins - Alpha / Beta; 
5-10 mins - Theta / Alpha; 
10 - 15 mins -Alpha / Beta; 
etc. etc.  up to one hour. 

This quick interplay between beta and theta/alpha promotes a balance between concrete thought and creative abstraction. This way we can encourage and bring to light new insights, generate new & original ideas, contemplate a concept from various points of view, and problem solve holistically. The beta phases serve to not only promote focus and concentration, but to also analyse, organise and therefore make sense of the abstractions derived from the more non linear holistic mind states induced by Theta and Alpha. 

In addition to using this audio during work or study, you can also use it in a rested state while meditating to assist with creative visualisation. 


As binaural beats have been integrated into this track, we recommend using headphones.

2520,d8VA7_qSC7U,With One Voice in Montreal: Art and Music Helping Homeless People.,"""Art to me is a humanitarian act and I believe that there is a responsibility that art should somehow be able to effect mankind, to make the world a better place.""  ~ Jeff Koons

Something I don't talk about very often is that at its very core Invisible People is art. Years ago, my boss at the time had in his office a coffee table book of photos of homeless people. The pictures humanized homeless men, woman, and families as the real people that they are. I said to myself: ""I could do this with video."" Shortly after, I was laid off and Invisible People was started. If you'd like to learn more about my story and how Invisible People started, please watch this documentary 

Art and music have the power to bring people together and change our world for the better. Both art and music can play a huge role in giving homeless people a purpose. Yes, housing ends homelessness but just putting homeless people in boxes will never end homelessness. People need to thrive and not just survive. Art therapy and music therapy are powerful tools for wellness, and as you'll see in this vlog - art, music, and theater can be used for advocacy to help change policy. 

Last year, With One Voice sent a delegation to the ATSA √âtat d'Urgence Festival in Montreal, Canada. It was an amazing few days meeting new friends and brainstorming on how we can help other creative organizations scale to have more impact helping homeless people. I shot a bunch of footage but never got around to editing it into something until this month. My dream is someday to be able to produce mini-documentaries like this vlog highlighting cool ideas and amazing people working to end homelessness who may not always get a lot of media attention.  

For example, in this vlog, I reference a video I shot when I was invited to the Dallas Public Library that you can watch here:  The folks behind With One Voice saw this video and invited Jo and Heather to Montreal to share about creating safe spaces. I hope to one day be able to produce more like this but on a much larger scale! 

In her interview, Beth Knowles from the City of Manchester and With One Voice references the North America Review of Arts and Homelessness that you can find here: 

From With One Voice's website: 

With One Voice began as a showcase event curated by Streetwise Opera at the 2012 Cultural Olympiad in London. For the first time in Olympic history, it gave a platform for homeless people ‚Äì celebrating the artistic achievements of 300 performers who had experienced homelessness.

About Invisible People: 

Invisible People goes beyond the rhetoric, statistics, political debates, and limitations of social services to examine poverty in America via a medium that audiences of all ages can understand, and can‚Äôt ignore. The vlog puts into context one of our nation‚Äôs most troubling and prevalent issues through personal stories captured by the lens of Mark Horvath ‚Äì its founder ‚Äì and brings into focus the pain, hardship and hopelessness that millions face each day. One story at a time, videos posted on InvisiblePeople.tv shatter the stereotypes of America‚Äôs homeless, force shifts in perception and deliver a call to action that is being answered by national brands, nonprofit organizations and everyday citizens now committed to opening their eyes and their hearts to those too often forgotten.

Invisible People is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to changing the way we think about people experiencing homelessness.",Art & Music
2521,P0Rlw8mo8g,Is Music Art? ‚Äì Hangout on Air,"In our fifth and final 'Hangout on Air', Miranda Sawyer is joined by artist Haroon Mirza, music producer Will Skeaping, record sleeve designer Leif Podhajsky and Tate's Adrian Shaw for a lively discussion about music and art.

Miranda Sawyer is a journalist, writer and broadcaster covering a wide range of interests, including music, art, radio and theatre. She is currently a feature writer and radio critic for The Observer, and is a regular arts critic in print and on television and radio. Miranda is also on the board of Tate Members.

Haroon Mirza is a British artist who combines a variety of readymade and time based material to create audio compositions, which are often realised as site-specific installations. In doing so, Mirza complicates the distinctions between noise, sound and music, and alters the function and meaning of everyday objects and and socio-cultural constructs.

Adrian Shaw is part of Tate‚Äôs Learning department, working on the Young People‚Äôs Programme. He has been organising music events since the early 1990‚Äôs and introduced large scale music programming to Tate over 10 years ago.  Now established as ‚ÄòLate at Tate‚Äô, these events often explore the boundaries between music, performance and art.  Adrian is also a musician, and one half of the arts duo boyleANDshaw.

Will Skeaping is a creative consultant and music producer. Following a tour of duty at Google, he worked closely with rappers, authors and film makers as label manager at Lex Records, focusing on collaborations between artists and musicians. He is currently making an album uniting English folk music with vintage analogue synthesizers. 

Leif Podhajsky is an Australian artist and graphic designer, who‚Äôs distinctive bright, surreal abstractions have featured on posters and album covers for musicians including Mount Kimbie, Tame Impala, Grimes, Lykki Li and Foals. Leif says his work ‚Äúexplores themes of connectedness, the relevance of nature and the psychedelic or altered experience.‚Äù

TONY BENNETT & R. SULLIVAN    Book Number: 74801    Product format: Hardback

With a career that spans 60 years and a fan base that spans all ages, Tony Bennett recently turned 80, and marked the milestone with a year-long creative outburst that included a chart-topping CD of duets with a diverse array of fellow superstar performers, from Streisand and Bono to Stevie Wonder and the Dixie Chicks. He starred in a sensational NBC TV special and performed in one sold-out show after another around the world. As if this were not enough, the UN named him 2007's Humanitarian Award honoree and the Smithsonian selected one of his paintings for their permanent collection. This lovely volume is a glorious celebration of Bennett's lifelong dedication to his passion for painting and singing. In a warm and revealing narrative, he and Robert Sullivan discuss the significant events of his life and career, his personal philosophy and the influences that continue to infuse his creative ability. He reflects on times he has shared with, and lessons he has learned from, the likes of Frank Sinatra, Pearl Bailey, Louis Armstrong, David Hockney and many, many more. Readers are whisked from his childhood, living above the grocery store where his father worked, to the magnificent apartment from where he now looks out over Central Park. Along the way he affords us a glimpse of his inner life. The book is richly illustrated with more than 200 reproductions - most of them previously unpublished - of his beautiful artwork, as well as a number of rare items from his collection. An endlessly entertaining 212 pages 29.5cm x 27cm very lavishly illustrated in colour and b/w with detailed appendix including a discography, art biography and an awards and honours listing as well as a FREE MUSIC CD of six tracks all performed by Tony Bennett.

2535,SDmdsuGr3KQ,Katawa Shoujo Beta - Shizune Act 3 (Full Art and Music),"Here is Shizune's Act 3. The official Steam forum dedicated to repairing the beta routes did not completely finish giving Shizune's route art and music direction, so I fixed it up myself. Knowing how to mod has never generated so many feels.

This is a playthrough of Shizune's Act 3 in the Beta of Katawa Shoujo. Act 1 was skipped due to it being exactly the same aside from the music and some grammar errors. Act 2 has been uploaded at  

I will upload Act 4 at some point in time, but I figured I should at least upload something pertaining to the beta route as of now instead of holding off everything.

I decided to keep the beta music in, but upon my insertion of art and music I put in some of the final version's music instead. The beta music just seems to fit the majority of the story in this route much better.

I came across a rather disturbing, yet slightly expected option in the beta that was either omitted or never finished. As it turns out, you could end up having sex with Misha at Shizune's house. During the scene where Misha confesses her love for Shizune, there was going to be a decision at some point in the conversation where you could choose to comfort her or refuse. If you do not comfort her, she tells you that she had a selfish thought that you would (this is shown at about  in the video) This effects multiple scenes, the most notable one being that Hisao and Misha agree to never tell Shizune about the affair. This in turn would not actually effect the story at all, but feelings of utter guilt would be inserted throughout many scenes. The most ridiculous part is that you could still get a good ending with Shizune, even after cheating on her, but I'll get into more detail about that once Act 4 comes along. For now, I will hold off the spoilers.

Katawa Shoujo is a bishoujo-style visual novel set in the fictional Yamaku High School for disabled children, located somewhere in modern Japan. Hisao Nakai, a normal boy living a normal life, has his life turned upside down when a congenital heart defect forces him to move to a new school after a long hospitalization. Despite his difficulties, Hisao is able to find friends‚Äîand perhaps love, if he plays his cards right. There are five main paths corresponding to the 5 main female characters, each path following the storyline pertaining to that character. This is the beta.",Art & Music

When I am faced with the whiteness of my creative page, I like to set limiting parameters before I begin my work. Choosing to limit my creative output can bring focus and direction. The following are a few examples of the concept of limitation:

1. Georgia O'Keeffe uses soft and wavy curves in her paintings (example: Flower of Life II)

2. Claude Debussy focuses on the pentatonic and the octatonic scales in his compositions.

3. The game of chess limits the movements of the pieces both collectively and individually.

2553,CQ4gxP2NGiQ,"Mathematics, Music, and Visual Art","Bridges 4: Mathematics, Music, and Visual Art

Our talks will explore some of the many connections between mathematics, music, and visual arts, using as a springboard our collaborative work-in-progress with the Kitchener-Waterloo symphony, to be premiered in April 2016. Dmitri will begin by describing the deep similarities between the languages of music and geometry, showing how elementary musical terms like ‚Äúchord‚Äù and ‚Äúvoice leading‚Äù correspond to geometrical concepts like ‚Äúvectors in an orbifold.‚Äù This correspondence in turn allows us to appreciate the hidden logic of particular pieces, the development of styles, and entire genres. Nathan will continue by showing how mathematical ideas can underwrite visually and conceptually striking visual art. The speakers will then join forces to describe some of the challenges and opportunities of using these ideas in creating a multimedia performance.

Nathan Selikoff plays with interactivity and motion in time and space. Inspired by the behavior of systems, science, nature, and music, he combines computer code, traditional materials, and future technology to bring new ideas to life. His award-winning artwork has been exhibited and performed in galleries and venues throughout the United States and around the world. Selikoff is represented by Snap! Space in Florida, Bangkok, and Amsterdam.

So now you know
We‚Äôre bought and sold
It never really mattered that much to me
I was just awake

And I just can‚Äôt get this out of my head
Cuz to me you were already dead

But my eyes now see through
What I need to do
I‚Äôd like to leave it all in the past and I swear that I‚Äôll never look back

And I just can‚Äôt get you out of my head
Cuz to me you were already dead

Kasey Jones is a driven, diverse and forward-thinking artist with a truly unique creative approach.  He is passionate about making intimate and poignant songs, often aided by simple production tools in the comfort of his own living room.
Inspired by the intimacy of folk and the grit of indie rock, Kasey‚Äôs work tips the hat off to artists as diverse as the Beatles, Elliott Smith or Wilco, making for a remarkably eclectic approach. Recently, he set out to complete the works on his new album, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs The Point‚Äù, a completely independent release, which was produced, recorded and engineered by Kasey Jones himself at his home studio. The artist even performed every instrument on this release, highlighting his versatility and broad musical scope.

One of the most exciting things about Art and Music is that Jones can exercise full creative control over every stage of the music-making experience, from conception to fruition!

His songs are filled with relatable lyrics and stunning melodies, which are catchy, yet richly nuanced and very direct.

2596,5TuwrYc8EDQ,"Conceptual Art, Writing, and Music with Gage McWeeny and David Lang","Conceptualism not only exists in the visual arts, but also in literature and music. Williams College Professor Gage McWeeny (Ph.D., English and American Literature, Princeton University) has devoted part of his career to the study of twentieth century and contemporary, experimental, or conceptual writing and art. Using Sol LeWitt's wall drawings as a connection to conceptualism in literature, McWeeny sheds light on the writings of Andy Warhol, Kenneth Goldsmith, and others.

David Lang, Pulitzer Prize winning composer for the ""Little Match Girl Passion"" (2008) and co-founder of the musical group Bang on a Can, will also make similar connections between Sol LeWitt's art and his own conceptualist and modernist compositions, as well as the conceptual music of Steve Reich and Tom Johnson.

   http://moyaokruga.ru/niva/Articles.as...

The competition was attended by pupils of the Children's Art School, who were prepared for it's performance by conductors teachers of this institution of additional education. The concert program included 26 everything numbers. It's includes a playing on musical instruments (solo performance) and dance numbers. For the first time, the jury presented the artworks of children studying at the art department of the School of Arts, also included musical and choreographic compositions, puppet shows.

The jury, which included: a methodologist of the department for coordinating the activities of educational organizations in the region of the Saratov regional educational and methodological center N.Ye. Mikhailova, lecturer of the cyclic commission ""Choral Conducting"" of the Saratov Regional College of Arts by name O.V. Oschepkova, a teacher of the highest category of the Central Children's Music School in Saratov, Ye.G. Alferova, teacher of the highest category of the Children's Art School.by name V.V. Kovaleva municipal formation ""City of Saratov"" T.V. Chubarov.
 I had to closely monitor the performance of the participants of the competition. To say that the guys and girls were not worried would be wrong. Of course, they long time and stubbornly went to it's concert to showing their skill and talent performed at this stage.

And to look, really was what here in. The vocal and choral group by name ""Arioso"" by  woman conductor  E.S.Senckevich, always amazes with it's many tember voices and vocal singing skills, the ability to perform virtuosly work in one breath there. But this time, the guys have surpassed themselves, I'm think. 
Valentina Alontseva, Yaroslav Kisilyov, with her playing the accordion, showed how close this instrument is to them too.
 Egor Zimenkov, Ivan Stepantsov, Ali Isengaliev, Alexei Baranov with the support of teacher of children's schools by accordion class N.A. Shvydkovoy forced the viewer no breath. Polina Galitskaya, Maria Gulak, Maria Oleinikova, Sarsen Incarbekova (upright piano) and others were able to subordinate grand piano, make it laugh and sob theirs playing. The performance of Nikita Kutakhin and Andrei Kulzhanov, known as the duo ""NikAnder"", took place nice again.
The ""dance"", a children's dance group known in the region, "" has flashing"" on the dance floor, adding to the grace and plasticity the brightness of theirs costumes and owns enthusiasm that was passed to all those who came to see and support the contestants on this important day.

The jury had the opportunity to evaluate the performance of the guys from ""CANAREYKA"" original name (canary-finch) puppet theater. Although the artists themselves are not visible during the performance, they tried to convey the emotions and feelings to theirs dolls, playing as sincerely as possible so that the viewer believed in the reality of what was happening here.

Christina Skrypnyk performed in the nomination ""solo performance, vocal"". Her performance fascinated the members of the jury, and it was she who passed the final selection. Art school teachers hope that our young ‚Äústar‚Äù will take part in the gala concert, which will be held in the regional center (Saratov city). And we wish her good luck and we shall believe and hope in her victory in!

After a hiatus, London electronic Jazz outfit Portico Quartet has returned with a new album, and we have them in studio to play two tracks from the record, 'Endless' and 'A Luminous Beam.' Their compositions meld acoustic and electronic soundscapes, jungle-style breakbeats and loose percussive grooves. As the title of current album ""Art In The Age Of Automation"" suggests, they're not interested in musical regression, but rather in ""What it means to make music in the modern age, to mix human art and computer art.""

Sinks your soul and it stamps a date

Maybe you can reach me now and again 
But I don‚Äôt think that time is a friend

Buy a ship and sail far away

This is the reason you're doing this stuff. It's the reason that consistency and repetition over time is so crucial -- because you have to occupy a space in someone's brain. This isn't just bombarding people with marketing messages.

Before anything can happen, before you can impact people in a positive way with your gifts and talents, before they can support you, before they can purchase anything from you, before they can attend any of your events ... you have to occupy a space in their consciousness.

And these days, more than ever, people are on information overload. So your job isn't to bombard them with more stuff. It's to stay ""top of mind.""

Why? Because you know you have valuable stuff for them. You know what you create can help a certain type of person. Not everyone, but a certain slice of the population will benefit (and maybe already does benefit) greatly from what you offer the world.

If you continue to reach out to those types of people consistently and repetitively, over time, they're going to be reminded that you are there to serve them, that you're there to entertain them, that you're there to make them feel good in an often dreary world.

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756‚Äì1791) was a prolific and influential composer of the Classical era. Born in Salzburg, he showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. At 17, Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court, but grew restless and traveled in search of a better position. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his death. He wrote more than 600 works, many acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral music. He is among the most enduringly popular of classical composers, and his influence is profound on subsequent Western art music. Ludwig van Beethoven composed his own early works in the shadow of Mozart, and Joseph Haydn wrote: ""Posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years"".

Original music for 's 

SO this piece took research to pull off, I'd read that Matt had based a lot of Wildemount's culture off of real life Eastern European examples and I remember hearing a while back that his favourite instrument was violin so I implemented a mix of Eastern European folk music (Polish, Hungarian, etc.) into a very rhythmic orchestral. I'd started this piece a few days prior to the first episode so the fact that they're using music from the Witcher series actually coincides quite well with this. You may have noticed but I also worked Jason Charles Miller's original main theme into the ending and a violin passage mixed in with my own theme. 

I'll go into a more in depth analysis if enough people want to know how this was made.",Art & Music

This program is open to the people of all age groups and multiple ethnicities in the style that they themselves are the speakers and listeners with the Lok Virsa as regulator and facilitator only.

Participants are encouraged and allowed to bring their musical instruments and artifacts they specialize in. They are motivated to share the values, knowledge, wisdom, stories, songs, tales, fables, epics, jokes, traditional games, riddles etc. overall everything falling within the domain of folklore of their respective regions. Amateur singers and musicians among them sing and play music. 

In this session we would explore the folklore of Kalash valley. Mr. Luke Rehmat and Mr. Geo Bangali Kalash would talk about, and represent their community, on the occasion. As an activist, Luke Rehmat would share the characteristic features of the birth to death rituals, festivals, folk cuisine, and folk festivals of the  people.

This discussion spills over into debates about art's value to society ---- whether access to the arts is right as basic as education or health care, and whether it should be assessed and supported by government or left to the ""invisible hand"" of the free market. President Botstein explains why it is essential to ask these questions and offers a sturdy basis for evaluating them. He goes so far as to suggest that engaging with art can give our lives meaning and purpose.

'Vermeer and Music: The Art of Love and Leisure' offers an opportunity to enjoy a selection of 17th century Dutch masterpieces alongside period musical instruments, with accompaniment from the Academy of Ancient Music. Featuring five rare works from Johannes Vermeer, including three paintings of women with musical instruments from 1670 - 1672, which forms the culmination of the exhibition and offers a unique opportunity to view these works as a trio. 

Join exhibition curator Betsy Wieseman as she explains how Vermeer's musical subjects explore variations on a similar theme - in much the same way that a musician might. And listen to music of the era played by musicians from the Academy of Ancient Music.

Find out why music was such an important part of society in the Dutch Golden Age -- and why the guitar was believed to be an instrument of the devil.

2645,0aO7m6O3g-g,"The Escape Festival of Art and Music 2013 - Naukuchiatal, Uttarakhand, India | CULTURE","BY AJAY JAIN

If you want to get a feel of art and culture, head to the Indian Himalayas for the annual Escape Festival that place in the summers. It takes place along the lakes of Naukuchiatal in the state of Uttarakhand, about an eight hour drive from New Delhi. Here is more about the festival as taken from the official website,  

""A unique festival started in May 2009 when a few musicians and like-minded people decided to get away from New Delhi for a few days. They chose a picturesque resort at Naukuchiatal, at the foothills of the Himalayas which became their Escape.

Escape, has grown since then to become one of India's foremost outdoor art, music & camping festival.

The Escape Festival of Art and Music, which has established itself in the past four years, is the perfect way to spend some quality time with friends and family. It is also one of the first festivals in the country set around a scenic getaway appealing to young and old alike. 

Three days. Two stages. One pristine lake. The lilt of music in the hills, the sublime experience of art, the unfettered sense of joy as you give into the magic of the moment.

Enough reasons to escape amidst the serene surroundings of Naukuchiatal. The three-day Escape Festival of Arts and Music, in its 6th Chapter in 2013, has slowly but surely become the cause of a mass exodus of all music fans from the summer heat. The Escape Festival of Art & Music addresses the needs of a wide group of artists and audience by bringing them together under one roof. It sets the benchmark in showcasing talent and creating a unique atmosphere of creative exchange and camaraderie amongst its attendees. The 'real time' experience coalesces into a unique experience which can only have the fitting title term of 'Escape'. 

An initiative by Potheads, the Escape Festival of Art & Music, is a creative retreat and will feature bands, artists, writers, photographers, painters, graffiti artists, performance artists, tattoo artists and potters, in a m√©lange of talent. In addition to that, the festival will also feature a festival camp, adventure sports and a flea market at the breathtaking venue right on the shores of Lake Naukuchiatal, Uttrakhand. The Escape Festival of Art and Music, which has established itself in the past four years, is the perfect way to spend some quality time with friends and family.

In its 6th Chapter, The Escape Festival of Art and Music 2013 will see the performances spread over three days and two stages - The Soul Garden Stage and the Magic Forest Stage.

The Soul Garden is aimed at a listening audience with the lake as a backdrop for the stage. This stage will feature some of the most musically talented artists from the genres of Jazz, Blues, Folk, Sufi and Rock Music from the four corners of India

The Magic Forest is an EDM (Electronic Dance Music) Stage supported by an elaborate array of lights and visuals. The Magic Forest Stage will feature National and International Artists from the EDM sub-genres of Chill, Dub-step, Drum'n'Bass and Psytrance Music.

The festival also features a mini film festival, which is the screening of independently produced documentaries by National and International film makers.

In the areas of Photography, Painting, Pottery, Graffiti and other art forms outdoor exhibitions, live painting, workshops and participation programs will be the order of the day wherein one will experience art in a natural setting.""

2657,N0u04EqNVj,The Art of Punk - Black Flag - Art + Music - MOCAtv,"On the first episode of ""The Art of Punk"" we dissect the art of the legendary Black Flag. From the iconic four bars symbols, to the many coveted and collected gig flyers, singles, and band t-shirts, all depicting the distinctive Indian ink drawn image and text by artist Raymond Pettibon. We start off in Los Angeles talking to two founding members singer Keith Morris, and bass player Chuck Dukowski, about what the scene was like in 1976 - setting the stage for the band's formation, as well as the bands name, and the creation of the iconic four bars symbol. Raymond Pettibon talks with us from his New York art studio. Back in LA we meet with Flea, from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, about how the art, the music, and that early LA scene impacted his own life and career. To wrap it all up we sit and talk at length, with Henry Rollins, at MOCA Grand Ave in Los Angeles, about all of the above and more. 


Created, directed, and Executive Produced by writer/author of 'Fucked Up + Photocopied', Bryan Ray Turcotte (Kill Your Idols), and Bo Bushnell (The Western Empire), The Art Of Punk traces the roots of the punk movement and the artists behind the iconic logos of punk bands such as: Black Flag (Raymond Pettibon), The Dead Kennedys (Winston Smith), and Crass (Dave King).

In addition to profiling the artists, the series includes intimate interviews with former band members, notable artists, and celebrities who have been heavily influenced by the art of punk rock including Jello Biafra, Tim Biskup, Scott Campbell, Chuck Dukowski, Flea, Steve Olson, Penny Rimbaud, Henry Rollins, Owen Thornton, and Gee Vaucher.

The filmmakers Bryan Ray Turcotte and Bo Bushnell take a unique approach to exploring the rich histories of these three seminal punk legends by focusing on the influential imagery and seeking out stories that have not been told yet through the artwork, which is integral to the importance and influence of each band.

On June 11, 2013 The Art Of Punk debuts on MOCAtv with an episode on Raymond Pettibon and the artwork of Black Flag. The stories behind the art of the Dead Kennedys will debut on June 18, and June 25 will see the release of the Crass episode, all of which will be available at: www.youtube.com/MOCAtv

2658,81OS9hC85g,ART OF DARKNESS | Animated Bendy and the Ink Machine Song!,"BLIMEY. This one took a while! Believe it or not I started working on Art of Darkness not long after I completed my first Bendy and the Ink Machine song, Find the Keys! But when the channel took off I realised that I should prioritise making more regular content over one big video so I've spent the past year working on this one bit by bit between other videos. I'm so glad to finally be able to share it with you guys!

Given how long it took to make, it went through many changes. It started as a Chapter 3 song but as time went by it ended up including parts of Chapter 4 and 5 too!

A huge amount of work went into this one (over 1000 drawings!) so I want to thank everyone who helped and supported me along the way! All of the drawings, animation, lyrics and voices are my own. But if you find a spelling mistake, my girlfriend did the spell checking. ;)

If you enjoyed the video, please do share! This is a super special project for me and I'd love for everyone to get a chance to see it!

So as I now finally get to work on my next song, I hope in the mean time... You find this one Satisfactory.

If you'd like, you can support my work over on Patreon!

2659,HysDgonGMCI,Art and Music are Antidotes to Intolerance: Shubha Mudgal,"Shubha Mudgal, noted composer and singer of Hindustani classical music as well as an archivist of enterprises, has launched initiatives like www.sangeetkosh.net and www.underscorerecords.com with partner Aneesh Pradhan. Most of all a voice of resistance and protest, Shubha speaks to Communalism Combat about her personal journey. As a young student who grew up in the rich cultural and academic milieu of Allahabad, Shubha began with kathak dancing, worked as a broadcaster with All India Radio and from the proceeds of her hard earned work bought her first tanpura.  Shubha then trained in Hindustani classical music under Pandit Ramashreya Jha in Allahabad, later Pandit Vinay Chandra Maudgalya in Delhi.

In this free-wheeling conversation with Teesta Setalvad, she speaks of the rich values of diversity that the Hindustani music and arts culture encapsulates, also recalling wonderful anecdotes of how leaders of the national movement like Nehru and Gandhi involved a vast array of Indians, including less visible citizens to participate in the ousting of British rule.

Keen on art and music education being introduced to Indian children at a young age, she recounts how her own personal experience of these rich and diverse worlds opened doors of the mind and heart. ‚ÄòArt and music are antidotes to intolerance‚Äô says Shubha, firmly endorsing the strong creative protests across the length and breadth of the country.

Shubha Mudgal is a regular part of SAHMAT‚Äôs January 1 celebrations every year. She speaks of the transformative experience of performing there. SAHMAT was formed after the brutal killing of Safdar Hashmi twenty-six years ago. On January 1, 1989, 34 year old Safdar Hashmi, poet, playwright and political activist with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) was beaten up by hoodlums belonging to the Congress party led by Mukesh Sharma while attempting to stage a play at Jhandapur in Sahibabad. He died from his injuries the next day. SAHMAT soon emerged as a strong artist and academic collective against the voices of authoritarianism and communalism.

On February 27, 2012, Shubha Mudgal performed at Gulberg Society as part of the tenth memorial of the Gujarat genocide. Her stage was the roof of a house where 19 people were killed. Those that soaked up the renderings of Shubha, Aneesh Pradhan and Sudhir Patwardhan were over 1,000 survivors of the pogrom from all over Gujarat along with human rights defenders.

She ends with the vocal rendering of Sahir Ludhianvi, ‚ÄúAao koi khwaab bune kal ke waste‚Ä¶‚Äù

2663,4B6YmM5m7H,Funky Art and Music Collaboration,"Sharing the same creative energy, even though the music was in Sedona and the art was happening in New York. Always cool to happen upon these moments!

Angie Durbin is a New York based artist whose work is very calligraphic and rhythmic, inspired equally by the energy of people, letterforms and music. The compositions are never planned and are executed spontaneously using instincts and subconscious emotions. Her unique style is packed with symbolism and movements that give each viewer their own experience in each piece.

2669,9RQ-Ha9JmpI,"The Harlem Renaissance: The Rise of African American Literature, Art, and Music","This short film, produced and created by Rob Johnson of San Rafael, CA,  is an introduction to an interdisciplinary unit on the Music, Art, and Literature of the Harlem Renaissance. The Harlem Renaissance (also known as the Black Literary Renaissance and the New Negro Movement) refers to the flowering of African American cultural and intellectual life during the 1920s and 1930s. At the time, it was known as the ""New Negro Movement"", named after the 1925 anthology The New Negro edited by Alain Locke. Centered in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City, the movement impacted urban centers throughout the United States. Across the cultural spectrum (literature, drama, music, visual art, dance) and also in the realm of social thought (sociology, historiography, philosophy), artists and intellectuals found new ways to explore the historical experiences of black America and the contemporary experiences of black life in the urban North. Challenging white paternalism and racism, African-American artists and intellectuals rejected imitating the styles of Europeans and white Americans and instead celebrated black dignity and creativity. Asserting their freedom to express themselves on their own terms, they explored their identities as black Americans, celebrating the black culture that had emerged out of slavery, as well as cultural ties to Africa. The Harlem Renaissance had a profound impact not only on African-American culture but also on the cultures of the African diaspora. Afro-Caribbean artists and intellectuals from the British West Indies, who had migrated to New York in number, were part of the movement. Moreover, many French-speaking black writers from African and Caribbean colonies who lived in Paris were also influenced by the Harlem Renaissance.[1] Historians disagree as to when the Harlem Renaissance began and ended. It is unofficially recognized to have spanned from about 1919 until the early or mid 1930s. Many of its ideas lived on much longer. The zenith of this ""flowering of Negro literature"", as James Weldon Johnson preferred to call the Harlem Renaissance, is placed between 1924 (the year that Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life hosted a party for black writers where many white publishers were in attendance) and 1929 (the year of the stock market crash and the beginning of the Great Depression). In 1917 Hubert Harrison, ""The Father of Harlem Radicalism,"" founded the Liberty League and The Voice, the first organization and the first newspaper of the ""New Negro Movement"". Harrison's organization and newspaper were political, but also emphasized the arts (his newspaper had ""Poetry for the People"" and book review sections). In 1927, in the Pittsburgh Courier, Harrison challenged the notion of the renaissance. He argued that the ""Negro Literary Renaissance"" notion overlooked ""the stream of literary and artistic products which had flowed uninterruptedly from Negro writers from 1850 to the present"", and said the so-called ""renaissance"" was largely a white invention.

lyrics:
A blacksmith courted me, nine months and better
he fairly won my heart, wrote me a letter
with his hammer in his hand, he looked quite clever
and if I were with my love, I'd live for ever

Oh where is my love gone with his cheeks like roses?
and his good black billycock on decked round with primroses?
I'm afraid the shining sun will burn and scorch his beauty
and if I were with my love, I'd do my duty

Strange news is come to town, strange news is carried
strange news flies up and down that my love is married
I wish them both much joy though they don't hear me
and may God reward him well for the slighting of me
Instrumental (Verse with Recorder or Fiddle)

What did you promise me when you lay beside me,
and you said you'd marry me and not deny me
If I said I'd marry, t'was only for to try you
so bring your witness love and I'll not deny you

Oh, witness I have none save God almighty
and may he reward you well for the slighting of me
her lips grew pale and wan, it made her poor heart tremble
to think she loved a one and he proved deceitful.",Art & Music

2689,nR-MVt_2lJA,"Discover the Art of Ben Heine: Drawing, Painting, Photography, Music, Teaching, Pencil Vs Camera...","Presentation of Ben Heine Art

https://www.benheine.com



Ben Heine is a Belgian multidisciplinary artist and music producer born in 1983 in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, currently living and working in Brussels, Belgium. He is best known for his original series ‚ÄúPencil Vs Camera‚Äú, ‚ÄúDigital Circlism‚Äù and ‚ÄúFlesh and Acrylic‚Äú. He has a Master degree in Journalism completed at IHECS school of Journalism in Brussels. He also briefly studied History of Art, Painting and Sculpture at Hastings College of Arts & Technology in the UK. He is a self-taught person in drawing, photography and music. Throughout his academic training, he was also able to learn several music instruments (drums and piano) and several languages (French, English, Dutch Polish, Spanish and Russian). His artworks were exhibited in countless fairs and galleries in Belgium, Hong Kong, South Korea, the UK, Russia, Romania, The Netherlands, Italy, Germany, France, Canada, the US, Turkey, Brazil, and Spain. His works have been published in some of the most famous newspapers and magazines. Ben is an enthusiastic traveller, he loves discovering new cities and cultures, each one of them being a huge source of inspiration for his creative projects. Through his career path, Heine became the ambassador of famous brands such as Samsung and Mazda and he has worked for other clients such as Harbour City, Diesel, Turismo de Canarias, Semmel-Concerts, Kare Design, Moscow Planetarium, McCann Erickson, while still making time for personal projects. He started producing and composing music in 2012. A documentary about his work was released in 2012. Ben is married to Marta and they have two children. Ben‚Äôs father Hubert Heine was a commercial engineer and his mother Cathy Lebizay a choreographer and a dance teacher.

Pencil Vs Camera is an original visual concept invented and popularized by Ben Heine since April 2010. A new art form and the artist‚Äôs special trademark, it is also one of the most creative and powerful art concepts of the 21st century. The images in this series usually show a hand-drawn sketch held and photographed by the artist to infuse ordinary scenes with new surreal, visionary, or romanticized narratives. Ben‚Äôs visible hand represents the connection between the viewer, the artist and the artwork. Heine does not recreate photographs, but he reimagines them. In these images, he likes to tell a story and convey timeless messages using imagination, illusion, poetry and surrealism. Since 2012, many smartphone applications emulate Heine‚Äôs Pencil Vs Camera‚Äôs style. Several other artists have also borrowed from Heine‚Äôs innovations to create variations of his Pencil Vs Camera. They say imitation is the highest form of flattery. The concept has also become popular in many primary and secondary schools worldwide. It is used to stimulate students‚Äô imagination and encourage them to use new technologies and share their ideas.",Art & Music

2716,Z11No_5QgEQ,"THE ART, ARCHITECTURE AND MUSIC OF PRAGUE - Art Nouveau (5 of 5) Edward Saunders","THE ART, ARCHITECTURE AND MUSIC OF PRAGUE (Lecture 5 of 5)

Edward Saunders, freelance lecturer

LECTURE TITLES

1.  The city emerges
2.  Emperor Charles IV and the golden age of Bohemia
3.  Jan Hus, Emperor Rudolf II and Saint John of Nepomuk
4.  Baroque splendour and extravagance
5.  Alphonse Mucha and Czech Art Nouveau

Prague is one of the most beautiful cities of Europe and, uniquely, has remained largely unscathed by war for over three hundred years. Its fame rests upon a magnificent range of Baroque churches, palaces and public buildings embellished with art and sculpture from the eighteenth century. However, often overlooked, Prague also houses extraordinary examples of cultural works from a variety of other centuries, in particular the medieval period of the early fourteenth century and, at the other end of the time spectrum, the Art Nouveau movement.

The lectures will highlight major developments in Prague‚Äôs history from its origins in the ninth century up to today, while considering representative examples of works from successive artistic periods. Throughout the lectures, relevant excerpts of Prague‚Äôs musical tradition ‚Äì from religious chants and Hussite hymns to the compositions of the two towering figures of twentieth century Czech music, Smetana and Dvorak ‚Äì will be introduced.

Penelope's Song by Loreena McKennitt

Now that the time has come...
Soon gone is the day
There upon some distant shore
You'll hear me say....

Long as the day in the summer time
Deep as the wine dark sea
I'll keep your heart with mine...
Till you come to me....

There like a bird I'd fly
High through the air
Reaching for the sun's full rays...
Only to find you there...

And in the night when our dreams are still...
Or when the wind flows free
I'll keep your heart with mine...
Till you come to me...

Now that the time has come
Soon gone is the day
There upon some distant shore
You'll hear me say....

Long as the day in the summer time

2718,nuE_itWvnI,The Art and Music of Royal Street New Orleans,"There is lots of art and music on Royal Street.  In addition to the art galleries there are artists showing their work on Pirate's Alley and the section of Royal Street behind St. Louis Cathedral. In this video you first see the excellent trad jazz band that plays most days on the corner of Royal and St. Peters. Then we move up to the artists near the cathedral. There is some of my work, Bill Ives, and that of Jim Bilgere.  Next, we see a Mardi Gras parade by the children in a local school that features several brass bands, including Rebirth. There are also Mardi Gras Indians. Next, are the Irish celebrating St. Patrick's Day early, stopping at several bars including Pat O'Brien's. Then a brief look at the piano bar inside Pat O'Brien's. Finally, we see three second lines connected to weddings. These are just some typical street scenes on Royal Street. Come on down and join us.",Art & Music

2720,XCRbISUfU2Y,Convergence 2016: Electronic Music + Visual Art,"When it comes to Electronic Music + Visual Art, we have entered into a post-instrument era in which music and visual art born of technology produce contemporary, dynamic and convergent new forms. Traditional apparatus and techniques are displaced by computer based processes, virtual instruments, electronic hardware and custom machines, stems, patches, waveforms and midi. This inaugural residency welcomes artists working in rhythmic and experimental electronic music realms, digital visual artists, and those pursuing work that creates synergies between sound, music and art.

This Banff Centre residency provided the context for artists to research, conceive, prototype and present new artistic works, tools, techniques and perspectives for electronic music, sound, and visual creation. Under the artistic direction of Patti Schmidt and Jen Mizuik, and led by faculty Robin Fox and Uwe Schmidt with guest faculty who are specialists in their fields, the program offered sessions and workshops on modular synthesizers, electronic music software and hardware, visual creation software and methods, artistic process and philosophy, and the nature of live performance in these technologically dominated fields. Together artists, peers, and world-renowned faculty exchanged knowledge, discussed ideas, experimented with processes, created, collaborated, performed, and shared artistic experiences.

Artists presented their works-in-progress throughout the program. The nature of the practices involved determined the presentation format and ranged from live performances, informal presentations, installations, talks and workshops. Artists received technical and artistic guidance during the development of their projects and research. This video gives a glimpse into the coolness that was the 2016 Convergence Residency.

2722,2n57ng8qNbA,"Benefits of Art and Music ""Presentation""","Collin's version of a presentation on ""The Benefits of Art and Music in Education"" recorded on April 29th, 2013.

Lyrics:
Music and art just cost so much
The school can‚Äôt pay for it and such
It‚Äôs just stressing the social divide
They take more time away from class
I feel like my students will never pass
How will we ever coincide?

But wait that‚Äôs not even the truth
There‚Äôs way more benefits for our youth
Than problems that you‚Äôll find
Academic s go through the roof
Listen on up there‚Äôs tons of proof
How could we have ever been so blind?

And hopefully you‚Äôll always support the arts
‚ÄòCause you will see how they make your students smart
And I can‚Äôt stress it near enough they‚Äôll be better all around
At least that‚Äôs what all the studies have found

Music and art for little kids
Can help develop reasoning and language
Earlier than you could ever bet
Music lessons help kindergartners perform best
On spatial-temporal reasoning tests
And there‚Äôs even more to come yet

It‚Äôs even better than a computer appliance
At teaching skills needed to do math and science
I‚Äôm telling you they‚Äôll help student to go far
Music Ed helps develop creative thought
This song hits that one on the dot
This presentation idea‚Äôs quite bizarre

And hopefully you‚Äôll always support the arts
‚ÄòCause you will see how they make your students smart
And I can‚Äôt stress it near enough they‚Äôll be better all around
The advantages you‚Äôll find will be profound

SPOKEN WORD FACTS

And hopefully you‚Äôll always support the arts
‚ÄòCause you will see how they make your students smart
And I can‚Äôt stress it near enough they‚Äôll be better all around
What they‚Äôre capable of might just astound

The arts can also have effects
In the behavior of its subjects
Discipline issues are rarely there
Students here do not misuse
They show the lowest substance abuse
Of high school students anywhere

And who does better on standardized tests
No matter what a child‚Äôs background may suggest
Students of the arts will succeed
And when your job hinges on that final grade
Thank the arts for all the aid
And helping your students achieve

And hopefully you‚Äôll always support the arts
‚ÄòCause you will see how they make your students smart
And I can‚Äôt stress it near enough they‚Äôll be better all around
Plus it‚Äôs much harder with music to feel down

And there‚Äôs even more ways to benefit
It teachers hard work and to commit
Only through practice can one excel
Rhythmic people tend to plan better
I guess not me putting this thing together
I don‚Äôt think that really went so well

But as I worked all through the night
This idea seemed to fit the topic just right
So I wrote it like this anyway
If there‚Äôs one thing I want you to learn
Embarrassing yourself like this should be no concern
When you teach you‚Äôll do it everyday

And hopefully you‚Äôll always support the arts
‚ÄòCause you will see how they make your students smart
And I can‚Äôt stress it near enough they‚Äôll be better all around
At least that‚Äôs what all the studies have found

And now I‚Äôm done standing up here like a clown",Art & Music
2723,ZH4DqgvkE0k,"EarthBound - A Quirky Artistic Synergy of Story, Art and Music | Game Audio Lookout","In fact, there‚Äôs many ways how the three elements writing, artwork and sound can play together. There‚Äôs AAA titles with cinematic writing, photorealistic graphics and epic orchestral music on the one hand [footage of Assassin‚Äôs Creed]. Another good example is the ‚ÄúSuper Mario Odyssey‚Äù world ‚ÄúSteam Gardens‚Äù with its funky vibes due to a coherent artistic feel of character design, graphics and audio. But today, we‚Äôll go back to the Super Nintendo era to have a look at one of the strangest games Nintendo ever created: ‚ÄúEarthbound‚Äù

2736,4B6YmM5m7H,Funky Art and Music Collaboration,"Sharing the same creative energy, even though the music was in Sedona and the art was happening in New York. Always cool to happen upon these moments!

Angie Durbin is a New York based artist whose work is very calligraphic and rhythmic, inspired equally by the energy of people, letterforms and music. The compositions are never planned and are executed spontaneously using instincts and subconscious emotions. Her unique style is packed with symbolism and movements that give each viewer their own experience in each piece.

Capoeira is a Brazilian martial art that combines elements of dance and music. It was created in Brazil mainly by descendants of African slaves with Brazilian native influences, probably beginning in the 16th century. It is known by quick and complex moves, using mainly power, speed, and leverage for leg sweeps.
The word capoeira probably comes from Tupi, referring to the areas of low vegetation in the Brazilian interior.

This exhibition features an exciting selection of early work as well as very recent work by Ronnie and includes a number of portraits of The Rolling Stones. 

Created from an insider's perspective, Ronnie portrays his colleagues, his friends, and band-mates, both in group portraits and individually, with an insight and intimacy not accessible to anyone else. Through line and colour, he deftly captures the creative energy of his musical world, showing us a view different from what we might see in the concert hall or arena.

lyrics:
Lyrics: Caravanserai


A gentle breeze or lightning..This glancing life is like a morning star..
A setting sun, or rolling waves at sea in a storm..
A dancing dream of all eternity..

The sand was shimmering in the morning light
And dancing off the dunes so far away..
The night held music so sweet, so long
And there we lay until the break of day..

We woke that morning at the onward call
Our camels bridled up, our howdahs full
The sun was rising in the eastern sky..
Just as we set out to the desert's cry

Calling, yearning, pulling, home to you..

The tents grew smaller as we rode away..
On earth that tells of many passing days..
The months of peace and all the years of war
The lives of love and all the lives of fears..

Calling, yearning, pulling, home to you...

We crossed the river beds all etched in stone
And up the mighty mountains ever known
Beyond the valleys in the searing heat
Until we reached the caravanserai...

Calling, yearning, pulling, home to you
Calling, yearning, pulling, home to you...

What is this life that pulls me far away..
What is that home where we cannot reside..
What is that quest that pulls me onward
My heart is full when you are by my side...

Calling, yearning, pulling, home to you....",Art & Music

2758,fLgFtLLld4E,Math + Art = Music | Justin Davis | TEDxProvidence,"From the foundation of exchanging knowledge through communication, Justin weaves dancing, music, and art into the conversation with his talk turned performance. 

Justin Davis is a multi-talented performing artist who specializes in music, dance, and poetry. In 2011 Davis became cofounder and president of SPOKEN, a Rhode Island College student club for spoken-word poets and other artists. He also performs original songs and covers before live audiences throughout the State of Rhode Island and teaches dance throughout Rhode Island and Massachusetts. A youth development major with minors in dance and jazz studies, Davis hopes to integrate literacy with the arts. He envisions a program where theater students learn to write scripts, spoken-word poets learn to write poetry, musicians learn to write lyrics and choreographers learn to write about their concepts.

This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",Art & Music
2759,UPk56BR1Cmk,Why art is important | Katerina Gregos | TEDxGhent,"This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. Katerina Gregos is convinced that contemporary art has an important role to play in society, as one of the last frontiers of free expression. Today, artists and cultural practitioners, rather than politicians, are leading some of the key discussions about the state of the world. Contemporary artists challenge each and every one of us to reinterpret social and political events, and crack cemented opinions as well as dominant narratives propagated by the media and those in power. As an internationally respected curator, Katerina has curated a number of exhibitions dedicated to exploring the relationship between art, politics, democracy, the new global production circuits, and human rights. Let yourself be inspired by Katerina‚Äôs talk at TEDxGhent 2014, and find out what contemporary art can contribute to society.

Independent curator and exhibitions organiser

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",Art & Music

2761,xhPwMNZpgY,Wingmakers Music & Art,"There is something about this artwork and music  that touches one's soul. This particular piece (as with the others found at the Ancient Arrow site) is very busy, almost overwhelming to the eye.  I have tried to break it down for the eye and then put it back together again. The idea behind the paintings is that there is meaning in the symbols and there is communication that is going on at a deeper (subconscious?) level than we may readily perceive with our limited senses. The meaning of this piece is left up to the viewer and that is how it is and should be with all good art /music and myth I might add.  The work, for me, has spiritual meaning, yet if I was asked to tell you what exactly this piece is about, I could not. There is something sensual here to my ears and eyes, a multi-course feast (if you will) that the Creator (James?)  has brought together. This art and music is rumored to be from 'another universe.' It is modified (or somewhat diluted)  from the original because we don't have the same capabilities to perceive it display it and/or recreate it that the beings who created it have developed over eons. For instance, it is said that the pictures move or come alive when viewed in the individual chambers where they were found. Few have witnessed it . It is music and art that supposedly activates long dormant parts of our DNA, DNA that was intentionally genetically manipulated or altered by beings from other parts of the universe many thousands of years ago. Some on earth might have called them ""gods."" This is an ongoing, unfolding project designed by it's creators, the Lyricus teaching order, to open us up to dimensions we have here-to-fore not experienced. I am told we are now on the threshold of being ready for at least part of the information it can impart. The music and art here are from the Ancient Arrow site see: www.wingmakers.com also see www.Lyricus.org.",Art & Music

Where dips the rocky mountains,
To a soft and winter lake,
There lies a frosty island,
Where flapping herons wake.
With the sound of soothing rhyme,
Let me sing for you a time,
Of a world so far it seems,
Can be only found in dreams.

CHORUS:
Come away, O human child,
To the beauties of the wild,
Where your sorrows melt away,
For the worlds more full of weeping,
Than ye can understand.

As the waves of moonlight beckon,
For you to join me there.
As the soft, white jasmine petals,
Drift through the snowy air,
As the sounds of silence cease,
The melody of rest brings peace,
As the purring lions dance,
In the winter-tide brilliance,
As the sky above us glows.
And no more our troubles find us,
In this land that's free of woes.

CHORUS

Where the wandering waters fountain,
In the pools across the dale,
You can eye the reindeer prancing,
To their long forgotten tales.
As they leap and jump and bound,
Our hearts beat to the sound,
Under frosted, ivory sky,
With their sparkling antlers high,
Their hoof-beats serenade,
As we ride across the glade,
Through the silvery, silken snow,
In a wintry wonderland,
With the brisk wind at our backs.
Let me take you there...

CHORUS

As you close your eyes in slumber,
May you take me by the hand.
Let us go where joy and laughter,
Ne'r cease in that fair land.",Art & Music

2783,-toMaehfmQ,Strange Interactive Art Installation of Musical Instrument Inventions - Music Box Roving Village,"When the Music Box Roving Village  is installed in a new location they change and add new instruments so when you see it it won't look the same or have the same instruments as you see in this documentary -  This documentary exhibits strange musical instruments invented by the New Orleans Airlift collaboration.  It's an amazing installation a village of portable sculpture dwellings that double as musical instruments.  The walls literally make music. Musicians famous and not so famous perform concerts and then the public is invited to jam on the creations. Any one young and old can play! Airlift programming highlights our city's underground art and under-the-radar artists, transporting the dynamic street culture, living folk culture and growing contemporary arts scene of New Orleans to far-flung locations around the world for exhibitions, workshops, festivals, performances, and collaborative projects.

Airlift also brings influential artists from abroad to participate in collaborative endeavors with local artists in our own community. We believe that collaboration between artists and across communities shares resources, empowers learning and unites disparate groups in common and powerful goals.
New Orleans Airlift is an artist-driven initiative that collaborates and creates alongside the artists and communities we support.

Airlift was founded in 2008 by musician and artist manager Jay Pennington and Delaney Martin, a multi-media installation artist, as a response to the unparalleled destruction of Hurricane Katrina and its devastating aftermath which left local artists, like all New Orleanians, struggling for their lives and livelihoods.

Jay and Delaney recognized a need for new audiences who could support these artists as they rebuilt their city. They dreamt up a one-time project that took city artists to Berlin and called it The New Orleans Airlift after the Berlin Airlift of WWII. Other exchange projects that used an import/export model and a multidisciplinary approach soon followed and the name stuck.

New Orleans is the last great bastion of living folk culture in the United states. Airlift projects honor tradition alongside innovation, leading our artists, culture and communities in meaningful new directions.

He is  best known for his appearances on America‚Äôs Got Talent in 2013 /2014 and subsequent viral videos of his Levitation acts. His America's Got talent performances were viewed by more than 40 million people on YouTube alone!

""The popularity amongst Children across America following my viral appearances really inspired me, That I've been given an opportunity to be a good roll model for kids. Thats a great reason to wake up in morning"" -Wolverton
""My artistic Vision is greatly influenced by my upbringing in the Native American Peyote Way Church and the Baha'i Faith. I realized that  1,000 years ago all art, performance, music, and dance was done through spiritual inspiration. The original performances were ritual and Ceremony. It wasn't until the Renaissance  that making a living through art became more widespread. Through my performances I intend to bring us back to an age of mysticism. Reminding people that performance is a ritual and that magic can be spiritual. 

The Special Head show goes beyond a traditional magic show. Not only does Wolverton perform Music while simultaneously performing magic illusions, Wolverton also incorporates thought provoking theatrics into his many acts. Danny uses illusions to cause the viewer to question ""what it means to be human."" His show is flexible and can be adapted to entertain many different age groups.

The Anarchestra is set up as an interactive art installation that the public gets to play. It can be tuned all to the same key making it hard to hit the wrong notes. You don't have to be a good musician to play it.

TONY BENNETT & R. SULLIVAN    Book Number: 74801    Product format: Hardback

With a career that spans 60 years and a fan base that spans all ages, Tony Bennett recently turned 80, and marked the milestone with a year-long creative outburst that included a chart-topping CD of duets with a diverse array of fellow superstar performers, from Streisand and Bono to Stevie Wonder and the Dixie Chicks. He starred in a sensational NBC TV special and performed in one sold-out show after another around the world. As if this were not enough, the UN named him 2007's Humanitarian Award honoree and the Smithsonian selected one of his paintings for their permanent collection. This lovely volume is a glorious celebration of Bennett's lifelong dedication to his passion for painting and singing. In a warm and revealing narrative, he and Robert Sullivan discuss the significant events of his life and career, his personal philosophy and the influences that continue to infuse his creative ability. He reflects on times he has shared with, and lessons he has learned from, the likes of Frank Sinatra, Pearl Bailey, Louis Armstrong, David Hockney and many, many more. Readers are whisked from his childhood, living above the grocery store where his father worked, to the magnificent apartment from where he now looks out over Central Park. Along the way he affords us a glimpse of his inner life. The book is richly illustrated with more than 200 reproductions - most of them previously unpublished - of his beautiful artwork, as well as a number of rare items from his collection. An endlessly entertaining 212 pages 29.5cm x 27cm very lavishly illustrated in colour and b/w with detailed appendix including a discography, art biography and an awards and honours listing as well as a FREE MUSIC CD of six tracks all performed by Tony Bennett.

Art Sex Music is the autobiography of a musician who, as a founding member of the avant-garde group Throbbing Gristle and electronic pioneers Chris & Cosey, has consistently challenged the boundaries of music over the past four decades.

It is the account of an artist who, as part of COUM Transmissions, represented Britain at the IXth Biennale de Paris, whose Prostitution show at the ICA in 1976 caused the Conservative MP Nicholas Fairbairn to declare her, COUM and Throbbing Gristle ‚ÄòWreckers of Civilisation‚Äô, and whose work continues to be held at the vanguard of contemporary art.

And it is the story of her work as a pornographic model and striptease artist which challenged assumptions about morality, erotica and art.",Art & Music

2819,dSMiYzBEPY8,Psychosocial programs like art therapy and music therapy help heal kids faster,"Childhood cancer is a family disease in that it affects the life of patients and their parents and siblings. Cancer can also significantly impact a child's psychosocial state - their emotions, behaviors, thoughts. A child's psychosocial state also impacts his or her relationships with family, friends, peers, etc. 

Art therapy and music therapy are just two of the many programs our staff offers to patients with cancer. These programs help patients express their emotions in a healthy, effective way. They also serve as a distraction when things get especially difficult during treatment or in the hospital.

Our therapists are nationally certified and offer the best possible care to our patients and often times engage the entire family in sessions.

You feel the cool vibrations and you start enjoying it...The cool vibrations soothe you down."" (Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi)

The Kundalini reaches the Sahasrara through the Sushumna (Central Path) and through the Chakras. The the Kundalini becomes one with God.

Eruptions and earthquakes, the building of continents, the formation of mountain ranges and oceanic trenches: all are powerful signs of the earth's structure and mechanics. Represented musically by the violent interruption of block rocking beats, video director Andrew Thomas Huang here depicts the push and pull of tectonic plates with anthropomorphized rocks, lava and sand encircling Bj√∂rk in dance, their psychedelic innards resembling the frayed strands of a Fritz Haeg rug.

2842,_FIxKNTyt5E,The Agony in the Garden - Rosary Meditation Aid - Art and Music,"An aid for meditation while praying the Rosary. The first Sorrowful Mystery is The Agony in the Garden. Just before he is betrayed by Judas and arrested to be crucified, Jesus prays in the Garden of Gethsemane. He struggles with the trial and suffering he knows he will soon face. Jesus' Agony In The Garden reassures you that you are not alone in your suffering.

Mark -36
""And he said to them, ‚ÄòMy soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch.‚Äô And going a little farther, he fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him. And he said, ‚ÄòAbba, Father, all things are possible to thee; remove this cup from me; yet not what I will, but what thou wilt.'""

Luke -45
""In His anguish He prayed with all the greater intensity, and His sweat became like drops of blood falling to the ground. Then He rose from prayer and came to His disciples, only to find them asleep, exhausted with grief.""

This projects preparation began in December of 2011 by researching the standpoint theory.

Founded in 1958, Guangdong Music and Folk Art Troupe is both a professional art troupe specializing in the creation, performance and research of Guangdong Music and Folk Art and a national intangible cultural heritage preservation unit of two major representative programs, namely, Guangdong Music and Cantonese Operatic Songs.
The Troupe possesses a great batch of Guangdong Music performers and folk art artists who own exquisite musicianship, rich experience and worldwide reputation.

After His death on the cross, Jesus' body was laid in the tomb. On the third day, they found the stone was rolled away and the tomb was empty. 

Mark 16:6
You need not be amazed! You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, the one who was crucified. He has been raised up; He is not here. See the place where they laid Him.

1 Corinthians , 17-20, 55
if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain. If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins. Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.  If for this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all men most to be pitied.
But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead
‚ÄúDeath is swallowed up in victory.‚Äù
‚ÄúO death, where is thy victory?
O death, where is thy sting?‚Äù

He is Risen! Hallelujah!

Music and art can be healing to the body and mind and she paints a beautiful picture for us showing how the two can come together in the form of the 'Creative Mind'. She strongly believes in the therapeutic power of music and uses it to aid recovery from illness. Dr. Ramya Mohan is a psychiatrist, artist, analyst, musician and an educator who is bridging the gap between neuroscience, mental health and creative arts to support brains better. Trained and qualified at both India and the UK, Dr. Mohan specializes in Child and Adult Psychiatry. An Autism champion for the South Surrey Autism board, Dr Mohan is passionate about bringing art and music together with the mind. In 2015, Dr Mohan founded iMANAS London, an organisation which aims to promote the integration of medicine, arts and neuroscience. A highly skilled artist and musician, Dr. Mohan travels the world as an invited guest speaker to discuss her work; her artworks have been displayed in exhibitions in both the UK and India. A formally trained Carnatic and Hindustani singer, Dr. Mohan believes in the therapeutic power of music and uses it to aid recovery from illness.

2868,P5kHf0LhIm8,How to be Creative - Developing Creativity - Art Music Writing etc.,"How to be Creative - Developing Creativity and Productivity - Art Music Writing etc.

In this video, I talk about how to be creative and create better projects by using two different types of thinking. For creative insights, I recommend what I call creative mod. Then, when you actually create, you go into editing mode. But it's important not to mix up these two thought processes.

Creativity and productivity are the two things needed to create a work of art. Many people spend forever in creative mode where new creative insights come up, but they never develop the productivity skills to bring those ideas to the world. On the other side, there are people who have created such a rigid system for creation that the editing related tasks completely nullify the ability for creative insights to come about. 

This process should work with many different art forms including but not limited to:

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (27 January 1756 ‚Äì 5 December 1791) was a prolific and influential composer of the classical era.
Born in Salzburg, Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court, but grew restless and traveled in search of a better position. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his early death at the age of 35. The circumstances of his early death have been much mythologized.

He composed more than 600 works, many acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral music. He is among the most enduringly popular of classical composers, and his influence is profound on subsequent Western art music. Ludwig van Beethoven composed his own early works in the shadow of Mozart, and Joseph Haydn wrote: ""posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years"".

Lyrics of some songs:

""Mon couer s'ouvre √† ta voix""  (Camilie Saint-Saens)
Mon c≈ìur s'ouvre √† ta voix,
comme s'ouvrent les fleurs
aux baisers de l'aurore!
Mais, √¥ mon bienaim√©,
pour mieux s√©cher mes pleurs,
que ta voix parle encore!
Dis-moi qu'√† Dalila
tu reviens pour jamais.
Redis √† ma tendresse
les serments d'autrefois,
ces serments que j'aimais!
|: Ah! r√©ponds, r√©ponds √† ma tendresse!
Verse-moi, verse-moi l'ivresse! :|

Ainsi qu'on voit des bl√©s
les √©pis onduler
sous la brise l√©g√®re,
ainsi fr√©mit mon coeur,
pr√™t √† se consoler,
√† ta voix qui m'est ch√®re!
La fl√®che est moins rapide
√† porter le tr√©pas,
que ne l'est ton amante
√† voler dans tes bras!
|: Ah! r√©ponds √† ma tendresse!
Verse-moi, verse-moi l'ivresse! :|
Samson! Samson! Je t'aime!



""De' Miei Bollenti Spiriti"" (Giuseppe Verdi)
Lunge da lei per me non v'ha diletto!
Volaron gi√† tre lune
Dacch√© la mia Violetta
Agi per me lasci√≤, dovizie, amori
E le pompose feste,
Ove, agli omaggi avvezza,
Vedea schiavo ciascun di sua bellezza.
Ed or contenta in questi ameni luoghi
Tutto scorda per me.
Qui presso a lei io rinascer mi sento,
E dal soffio d'amor rigenerato
Scordo ne'gaudii suoi tutto il passato.

De' miei bollenti spiriti
Il giovanile ardore
Ella tempr√≤ col placido
Sorriso dell'amor, dell'amor!
Dal d√¨ che disse:
Vivere io voglio io voglio a te fedel,
Dell'universo immemore
Io vivo, io vivo quasi,
Io vivo quasi in ciel.

Dal d√¨ che disse:
Vivere io voglio a te fedel,
Ah s√¨‚Ä¶dell'universo immemore
Io vivo, io vivo quasi,
Io vivo quasi in ciel.
Io vivo in ciel.
Dell'universo immemore.
Io vivo quasi in ciel.
Ah s√¨, io vivo quasi in cielo. 
Io vivo quasi in ciel.



""Apri la Tua Finestra"" (Pietro Mascagni)
Apri la tua finestra!
Jor son io
Che vengo al tuo chiamar,
Povera Dhia!
Apri la tua finestra
Al raggio mio!
Apri il tuo cor
A mia calda mal√¨a!
Jor ha ascoltata, o Dhia,
La tua preghiera!
Apri l'anima tua,
Fanciulla, al Sole!
Apri l'anima tua alle mie parole!
Apri il tuo cuore a me,
Fanciulla, e spera!
Tu vuoi morir?
Morire io ti far√≤
Ma ti far√≤ morir dal Sol baciata,
Poscia al paese eterno ti trarr√≤...
Ove, o fanciulla,
Tu sarai amata!

2915,k7ngnWJ6Hk,Music is a visual art | Hunter Ewen | TEDxBoulder,"This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. We can use visuals to better describe music. 

Hunter Ewen is a dramatic music composer, educator, and multimedia designer. During the day, Dr. Ewen teaches strategies for digital creativity at the University of Colorado, the children‚Äôs collaborative art center Reel Kids, the City of Longmont, and as an independent educator. At night, he composes, solders, choreographs, and directs interdisciplinary projects around the world. Experimental performance practices and unusual notation figure prominently in Ewen‚Äôs works. A believer that compositions should be both seen and heard, his music looks as strange as it sounds. Swirles, squiggles, arrows, and fangs often replace traditional notes and rests. His aesthetic preferences gravitate towards yowls and yips and wails and squeals. Towards screams that masquerade as art. Towards clamor and deviance. Ewen‚Äôs music swings from chandeliers.

2917,daVaEoF5Hrk,Arnold Sch√∂nberg - Wassily Kandinsky: Music and Art Get One,"The early years of the 20th Century signed a terrific advance in the Physical Sciences. The Special (1905) and General (1916)  Theories of Relativity and the advent of Quantum Mechanics (1926) changed our lives profoundly. Around the same years, a similar revolution took place in both Music and Art. The year 1909 marks a decisive break with tonality (the structure of classical music) by Arnold Sch√∂nberg in his ""Three Piano Pieces"". The term 'Atonality' is commonly used to express this new type of composition. Wassily Kandinsky is credited with painting the first 'purely abstract' works. His production is vast and I could only include 20 of his works here, selected from a period of time that overlaps with the musical pieces by Sch√∂nberg presented in this video. They knew each other and have possibly influenced their works reciprocally. The video is an attempt to evince this intriguing 'connection' between music and painting.


About Arnold Sch√∂nberg (1874-1951):
...The final piece (of the Three Piano Pieces, Op.11) breaks through all constraints of traditional language or structure, cutting abruptly from extremes of eruptive power, as in the massively congested opening, to the most intense introspection. Perhaps Schoenberg had in mind Kandinsky, with whom he had close  contacts, when he likened such music to developments in painting -""without architecture... an ever-changing, unbroken succession of colours, rhythms and moods."" (From a Text by Peter Hill).

About Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944):
...As the ""Der Blaue Reiter""(*) Almanac essays and theorizing with composer Arnold Sch√∂nberg indicate, Kandinsky also expressed the communion between artist and viewer as being available to both the senses and the mind (Synesthesia). Hearing tones and chords as he painted, Kandinsky theorized that, for instance, yellow is the colour of middle C on a brassy trumpet; black is the colour of closure, and the end of things; and that combinations of colours produce vibrational frequencies, akin to chords played on a piano. Kandinsky also developed a theory of geometric figures and their relationships, claiming, for example, that the circle is the most peaceful shape and represents the human soul.  (From Wikipedia).

Note Added: (*) Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider) was a group of artists from the Neue √ºnstlervereinigung M√ºnchen in Munich, Germany. The group was founded by a number of Russian emigrants, including Wassily Kandinsky, Alexej von Jawlensky, Marianne von Werefkin, and native German artists, such as Franz Marc, August Macke and Gabriele M√ºnter. Der Blaue Reiter was a movement lasting from 1911 to 1914, fundamental to Expressionism, along with Die Br√ºcke which was founded in 1905.

Songs From the Northern Territory 4: Aboriginal Music From North-Eastern Arnhem Land Including Groote Eylandt 
Artist/Collector: 
Alice Moyle 
Label Information: 
Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS): AIAS 4 CD 
Media Type: 
CD 
Year: 
Recorded 1963; Released 1997 
Availability: 
AIATSIS 

Notes: For the purpose of music description, Eastern Arnhem Land of the Northern 
Territory is divided here as follows: the north-eastern sector including offshore 
islands; the eastern sector, extending along the coast as far south as the Roper 
River; and the Groote Eylandt archipelago north-west of the Gulf of Carpentaria. 
Field recordings reproduced on this compact disc were collected at Milingimbi and 
Yirrkala in the north-eastern sector and at Angurugu and Umbakumba on Groote Eylandt.
 
The Aboriginal communities at Milingimbi and Yirrkala, together with the people at 
Galiwin'ku (previously known as Elcho Island) have been referred to in the 
anthropological literature as the Murngin (WL Warner) and Wulamba (RM Berndt). More 
recently, they have become known as the Yolngu, from a local word meaning 'people'. 
The people on Groote Eylandt were known by mainland groups as the Wayingurra and 
their language, Ingurra. In the absence of a name for the Groote Eylandters, 
Warnindilyakwa, a name formerly given to one of the larger clans on the island, is 
sometimes used. Anindilyakwa is the name of the island language. 
Item characteristics of Eastern Arnhem Land clan songs performed and recorded in 
the 1960s-all of which were sung by men-are summarised here as follows: (1) a didjeridu 
accompaniment which utilises two tones differing widely in pitch (the interval between 
the higher or overblown tone and the fundamental often sounding close to a tenth 
but varying according to the shape and length of the hollowed branch); (2) a narrow 
vocal range of pitch (compare them, for instance, with Western Arnhem Land songs) 
which rarely exceeds a fifth or sixth and may be less than a second; (3) song words 
which are translatable, meaningful and appropriate to relevant clan territories 
and related myths; and (4) the occurrence of an unaccompanied vocal termination (UVT), 
or termination of a song item by voice or voices alone after the accompanying 
instruments have ceased. Good examples of this fourth item characteristic are to be 
heard on this disc (Track 1) and disc 3 (Track 11). 
Song refrains may consist of repeated strings of words and syllables, a prolonged 
single syllable or a repeated pattern of vocal sounds (for example, bird calls). 
These calls are incorporated into the particular sectional or phraselike structure 
of many item sequences performed in Eastern Arnhem Land. 
On Groote Eylandt (tracks 7-13), only the first three of the above characteristics 
are to be heard. There is no occurrence of the UVT in these items but the following 
additional characteristics distinguish emeba (Groote Eylandt clan songs) from manikay 
(north-eastern Arnhem Land clan songs): 
a. the shaky voice, a deliberate manner of vocal ornamentation used by some emeba singers; 
b. the break or brief cessation of the vocal part of a Groote Eylandt clan song which is 
signalled by certain words the singer chooses to sing (the song subject at this point may 
fall, swoop down, or change abruptly in some way-it was said that the break gives the singer 
time to decide which words to sing next); 
c. a short, patterned interplay between sticks and didjeridu during the break; and 
d. the general clatter of stick-beating percussion arising from several different sources 
at the same time. 
Further comparison of emeba and manikay reveals that, whereas the durations of the latter 
are usually about one minute or less, emeba items may last for more than two minutes each.

Free Press Houston and Work-Order are proud to announce the lineup for Day For Night, an experiential arts and music festival featuring digital artists and renowned musical acts on December 19 and 20 in Houston, TX. Our 2015 lineup represents the culmination of years of development.

Musical artists featured: Kendrick Lamar, New Order, Philip Glass Ensemble, Dillon Francis, Janelle Mon√°e, Flying Lotus, Death Grips, Madeon, Nicolas Jaar, Psychic TV, CocoRosie, Elliphant, Battles, Dan Deacon, Com Truise, Cazwell, Amanda Lepore, Holly Herndon, Julien Bayle, Indian Jewelry, U.S. Girls, Jont√© Moaning, Prince Rama, DERU, Matt Thibideau, Roman Gianarthur, Richard Ramirez, Christine Renee, Future Blondes, BOAN, Millennial Grave, Wrestlers, Children of Pop, B L A C K I E, Hearts of Animals, Josiah Gabriel, FLCON FCKER, The Vanity, Light Wheel,Jerk, Bart Black, Prismo, and DJ Fredster. 

This immersive experience showcases leading visual artists who will be employing varying mediums such as light, projection, LED, and sound. The visual lineup includes Casey Reas, Zach Lieberman, School for Poetic Computation, Refik Anadol, Markus Heckmann, Mark Eats, Kamil Nawratil, Nanotak, Gabriel Pulecio, Vincent Houze + AV&C, Masomenos, David Cihelna & Gene Han, Mathew Dryhurst, Alex Czetwertynski, Work-Order, Night Moves, and Neil Ebbflo. 


Day For Night is currently the only confirmed U.S. date for New Order.

Passes to the two day art and music festival will be available at 10AM on Thursday, October 8, via www.dayfornight.io. Two ticket levels will be made available. General Admission will give access to the art installations as well as all musical performances on three stages for the entire weekend at a price of $185. VIP tickets are limited and will include front of stage pit access with private bar, complimentary beverages and small plates, access to private lounge, rapid entry, and commemorative lanyard for $750. Thousands of blind pre-sale tickets sold out in less than 24 hours when the event was announced in early September. 

Curator Alex Czetwertynski explains, ‚ÄúThe festival's title, ‚ÄúDay For Night,‚Äù provides the main key to understand the work being presented, as that space between day/night or light/dark is where our perception gets the blurriest. All of the artists in our roster will, in one way or another, transform our feeling of time, space, perspective, and place. They were chosen because of their common use of computational media to manipulate light, time, and sound. Their approaches to light and sound can be literal, or purely as a medium to reveal content.  And with the large scale canvas that Day for Night is offering these artists, we can only expect this audio-visual exchange to be a heightened sensorial experience.‚Äù

With acres of immersive installations within the emerging field of digital art and performances by world-class musicians, each are curated not just for their musical talent but also the visual qualities of their stage presence, Day For Night seeks to redefine the festival experience and inspire attendees to re-examine the way they interact with and understand both art and music.",Art & Music

2937,jvYTiPQAyAE,How art and music create a new hybrid global culture: Rajae El Mouhandiz at TEDxBreda,"The ""one story"" of Muslims and immigrants we hear in the news and politics every day is ignoring the many stories of millions of women and men who do not see themselves in that old story, but as authors and owners of a new story where globalism and hybrid cultures are the stage and vehicle. They represent a new story of being and belonging in the world. A story where history is honoured as the sacrifices of those who came before us. Their parents moved to the west to start something new, mixed with the old, and individuals like Rajae El Mouhandiz are the product. As the new stories they are shaping do not yet have a language and a platform, one has to start telling the stories through art and music. And personal strength.

Regarding Rajae El Mouhandiz
Rajae El Mouhandiz is a Dutch-Moroccan-Algerian poet, singer, composer, producer, and founder of the record label Truthseeker Records. After leaving her family at age 15 and being the first Moroccan to study at a Dutch conservatory at age 16. El Mouhandiz left classical music at age 20 to follow her own artistic path, seeking to incorporate her cultural roots. She started her own record label at age 25, released two albums and is currently developing her third album in Morocco. On international women's day 2013 El Mouhandiz premiered her first short documentary film, about the acceptance of Muslim women in mainstream media and the music industry. Currently she is developing her second short film, focusing on her Maghreb heritage and the story of her grandfathers. She is also one of the 60 female curators of the groundbreaking international MUSLIMA exhibition, held in The USA, The Philipines, The U.A.E and Denmark. And together with the British Council Ireland and a Dutch theatre production company, El Mouhandiz is producing the Dutch and European version of the Hijabi Monologues; a theatre space for the experiences of Muslim women; a space to breathe as they are; a space that does not claim to tell every story and speak for every voice. The Dutch premiere is planned in September 2014. Rajae was nominated as Muslim Leader of tomorrow in 2005. She was nominated by Elsevier magazine as one of Hollands' 10 biggest talents in 2007, in the field of contemporary music and from 2009 -- 2012 she was the only female contemporary artist to be nominated on the list of the 500 most influential Muslims in the world. This year Rajae has been nominated for the 5th year in a row. More information: www.rajae.net",Art & Music

The impulse to create art and music comes from deep evolutionary drives, explains Bill Nye the Science Guy. In the animal kingdom, song and visual displays are great tools for, um, flirting.

Transcript: Michael Montoya: Hi Bill. Michael Montoya here. What do you think is the evolutionary advantage to humanity being both musically and artistically creative? And where do you think this initial spark of creativity came from?

Bill Nye: Michael. Michael. This is a great question and susceptible to speculation. Apparently music and art is part of the way we communicate and it's certainly the way you attract mates. I'll just put it to you that way. Musicians and artists engage other people in a way that people who don't use music and don't use art do not. Now, there's a lot of talk about songbirds in evolutionary biology and they all have these songs, which must be pleasing to the ears of their potential mates and also must send messages to others of their species, so I guess to other species as well. I am angry; this is my territory; I'm looking for a mate; it's a sunny day. These sort of announcements are made by other species so you figure humans have just taken it just a whole other level with albums and record release parties and art exhibits and art museums and art galleries. So it really is deep within us and I think art enriches our lives, engages our brains and stimulates us in a way that nothing else we do does. So, this is only speculation on my part but music especially certainly inspires us. That's for sure. So carry on Michael. Turn it up loud.",Art & Music

""DEATH SQUAD ANTHEM"" LYRICS

If the mob wants blood
Then they‚Äôll fucking get it
You started this war
Now you‚Äôll fucking regret it

21st Century Death Squad Anthem
Your life is on the line
Your obedience is their ransom
21st Century Death Squad Anthem
The methods of peace are obsolete
So grab your guns and sing with me

Impatient in our rage
Force fed this disillusion
Missing a torn-out page
Suppress the revolution
All eyes on the big stage
Swept to the institutions
Complacent in our cage
Ready for the execution

21st Century Death Squad Anthem
Your life is on the line
Your obedience is their ransom
21st Century Death Squad Anthem
The methods of peace are obsolete
So grab your guns and sing with me

If the mob wants blood
Then they‚Äôll fucking get it

Riot, resist
Tyrants cease to exist
Riot, resist
Tyrants cease to exist

Divide and conquer
While they conjure
Divisive means
For the stronger
Addicted by design
To a system in decline

Arise the scourge of man
Divide the foolish
Dilute the masses
Deprived of liberty
We‚Äôll not stand by while
Society collapses

Impatient in our rage
Force fed this disillusion
Missing a torn-out page
Suppress the revolution
All eyes on the big stage
Swept to the institutions
Complacent in our cage
Ready for the execution

21st Century Death Squad Anthem

MP3 DOWNLOAD: https://www.brainwavehub.com/download...

Using a combination of Theta, Alpha and Beta frequencies, this audio is designed to act as an aid to your creative pursuits, encourage fluid, abstract thought processes while maintaining focus over long periods. 

The Theta / Beta frequencies range from 6-7hz & 13-15hz respectively, with 8-12hz alpha waves interspersed throughout. The patterns switch in the following manner, every 5 minutes: 

0-5 mins - Alpha / Beta; 
5-10 mins - Theta / Alpha; 
10 - 15 mins -Alpha / Beta; 
etc. etc.  up to one hour. 

This quick interplay between beta and theta/alpha promotes a balance between concrete thought and creative abstraction. This way we can encourage and bring to light new insights, generate new & original ideas, contemplate a concept from various points of view, and problem solve holistically. The beta phases serve to not only promote focus and concentration, but to also analyse, organise and therefore make sense of the abstractions derived from the more non linear holistic mind states induced by Theta and Alpha. 

In addition to using this audio during work or study, you can also use it in a rested state while meditating to assist with creative visualisation. 


As binaural beats have been integrated into this track, we recommend using headphones.

2971,d8VA7_qSC7U,With One Voice in Montreal: Art and Music Helping Homeless People.,"""Art to me is a humanitarian act and I believe that there is a responsibility that art should somehow be able to effect mankind, to make the world a better place.""  ~ Jeff Koons

Something I don't talk about very often is that at its very core Invisible People is art. Years ago, my boss at the time had in his office a coffee table book of photos of homeless people. The pictures humanized homeless men, woman, and families as the real people that they are. I said to myself: ""I could do this with video."" Shortly after, I was laid off and Invisible People was started. If you'd like to learn more about my story and how Invisible People started, please watch this documentary 

Art and music have the power to bring people together and change our world for the better. Both art and music can play a huge role in giving homeless people a purpose. Yes, housing ends homelessness but just putting homeless people in boxes will never end homelessness. People need to thrive and not just survive. Art therapy and music therapy are powerful tools for wellness, and as you'll see in this vlog - art, music, and theater can be used for advocacy to help change policy. 

Last year, With One Voice sent a delegation to the ATSA √âtat d'Urgence Festival in Montreal, Canada. It was an amazing few days meeting new friends and brainstorming on how we can help other creative organizations scale to have more impact helping homeless people. I shot a bunch of footage but never got around to editing it into something until this month. My dream is someday to be able to produce mini-documentaries like this vlog highlighting cool ideas and amazing people working to end homelessness who may not always get a lot of media attention.  

For example, in this vlog, I reference a video I shot when I was invited to the Dallas Public Library that you can watch here:  The folks behind With One Voice saw this video and invited Jo and Heather to Montreal to share about creating safe spaces. I hope to one day be able to produce more like this but on a much larger scale! 

In her interview, Beth Knowles from the City of Manchester and With One Voice references the North America Review of Arts and Homelessness that you can find here: 

From With One Voice's website: 

With One Voice began as a showcase event curated by Streetwise Opera at the 2012 Cultural Olympiad in London. For the first time in Olympic history, it gave a platform for homeless people ‚Äì celebrating the artistic achievements of 300 performers who had experienced homelessness.

To learn more about the people and the organizations in this video, here is a link to information about the delegates  For more information about With One Voice, please visit their website:

About Invisible People: 

Invisible People goes beyond the rhetoric, statistics, political debates, and limitations of social services to examine poverty in America via a medium that audiences of all ages can understand, and can‚Äôt ignore. The vlog puts into context one of our nation‚Äôs most troubling and prevalent issues through personal stories captured by the lens of Mark Horvath ‚Äì its founder ‚Äì and brings into focus the pain, hardship and hopelessness that millions face each day. One story at a time, videos posted on InvisiblePeople.tv shatter the stereotypes of America‚Äôs homeless, force shifts in perception and deliver a call to action that is being answered by national brands, nonprofit organizations and everyday citizens now committed to opening their eyes and their hearts to those too often forgotten.

2972,P0Rlw8mo8g,Is Music Art? ‚Äì Hangout on Air,"In our fifth and final 'Hangout on Air', Miranda Sawyer is joined by artist Haroon Mirza, music producer Will Skeaping, record sleeve designer Leif Podhajsky and Tate's Adrian Shaw for a lively discussion about music and art.

Miranda Sawyer is a journalist, writer and broadcaster covering a wide range of interests, including music, art, radio and theatre. She is currently a feature writer and radio critic for The Observer, and is a regular arts critic in print and on television and radio. Miranda is also on the board of Tate Members.

Haroon Mirza is a British artist who combines a variety of readymade and time based material to create audio compositions, which are often realised as site-specific installations. In doing so, Mirza complicates the distinctions between noise, sound and music, and alters the function and meaning of everyday objects and and socio-cultural constructs.

Adrian Shaw is part of Tate‚Äôs Learning department, working on the Young People‚Äôs Programme. He has been organising music events since the early 1990‚Äôs and introduced large scale music programming to Tate over 10 years ago.  Now established as ‚ÄòLate at Tate‚Äô, these events often explore the boundaries between music, performance and art.  Adrian is also a musician, and one half of the arts duo boyleANDshaw.

Will Skeaping is a creative consultant and music producer. Following a tour of duty at Google, he worked closely with rappers, authors and film makers as label manager at Lex Records, focusing on collaborations between artists and musicians. He is currently making an album uniting English folk music with vintage analogue synthesizers. 

Leif Podhajsky is an Australian artist and graphic designer, who‚Äôs distinctive bright, surreal abstractions have featured on posters and album covers for musicians including Mount Kimbie, Tame Impala, Grimes, Lykki Li and Foals. Leif says his work ‚Äúexplores themes of connectedness, the relevance of nature and the psychedelic or altered experience.‚Äù

TONY BENNETT & R. SULLIVAN    Book Number: 74801    Product format: Hardback

With a career that spans 60 years and a fan base that spans all ages, Tony Bennett recently turned 80, and marked the milestone with a year-long creative outburst that included a chart-topping CD of duets with a diverse array of fellow superstar performers, from Streisand and Bono to Stevie Wonder and the Dixie Chicks. He starred in a sensational NBC TV special and performed in one sold-out show after another around the world. As if this were not enough, the UN named him 2007's Humanitarian Award honoree and the Smithsonian selected one of his paintings for their permanent collection. This lovely volume is a glorious celebration of Bennett's lifelong dedication to his passion for painting and singing. In a warm and revealing narrative, he and Robert Sullivan discuss the significant events of his life and career, his personal philosophy and the influences that continue to infuse his creative ability. He reflects on times he has shared with, and lessons he has learned from, the likes of Frank Sinatra, Pearl Bailey, Louis Armstrong, David Hockney and many, many more. Readers are whisked from his childhood, living above the grocery store where his father worked, to the magnificent apartment from where he now looks out over Central Park. Along the way he affords us a glimpse of his inner life. The book is richly illustrated with more than 200 reproductions - most of them previously unpublished - of his beautiful artwork, as well as a number of rare items from his collection. An endlessly entertaining 212 pages 29.5cm x 27cm very lavishly illustrated in colour and b/w with detailed appendix including a discography, art biography and an awards and honours listing as well as a FREE MUSIC CD of six tracks all performed by Tony Bennett.

2986,SDmdsuGr3KQ,Katawa Shoujo Beta - Shizune Act 3 (Full Art and Music),"Here is Shizune's Act 3. The official Steam forum dedicated to repairing the beta routes did not completely finish giving Shizune's route art and music direction, so I fixed it up myself. Knowing how to mod has never generated so many feels.

This is a playthrough of Shizune's Act 3 in the Beta of Katawa Shoujo. Act 1 was skipped due to it being exactly the same aside from the music and some grammar errors. Act 2 has been uploaded at  

I will upload Act 4 at some point in time, but I figured I should at least upload something pertaining to the beta route as of now instead of holding off everything.

I decided to keep the beta music in, but upon my insertion of art and music I put in some of the final version's music instead. The beta music just seems to fit the majority of the story in this route much better.

I came across a rather disturbing, yet slightly expected option in the beta that was either omitted or never finished. As it turns out, you could end up having sex with Misha at Shizune's house. During the scene where Misha confesses her love for Shizune, there was going to be a decision at some point in the conversation where you could choose to comfort her or refuse. If you do not comfort her, she tells you that she had a selfish thought that you would (this is shown at about  in the video) This effects multiple scenes, the most notable one being that Hisao and Misha agree to never tell Shizune about the affair. This in turn would not actually effect the story at all, but feelings of utter guilt would be inserted throughout many scenes. The most ridiculous part is that you could still get a good ending with Shizune, even after cheating on her, but I'll get into more detail about that once Act 4 comes along. For now, I will hold off the spoilers.

Katawa Shoujo is a bishoujo-style visual novel set in the fictional Yamaku High School for disabled children, located somewhere in modern Japan. Hisao Nakai, a normal boy living a normal life, has his life turned upside down when a congenital heart defect forces him to move to a new school after a long hospitalization. Despite his difficulties, Hisao is able to find friends‚Äîand perhaps love, if he plays his cards right. There are five main paths corresponding to the 5 main female characters, each path following the storyline pertaining to that character. This is the beta.",Art & Music
